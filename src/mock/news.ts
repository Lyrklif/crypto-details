      content:
        'Key Insights\n\nWithin Q3, Bitcoin largely lost its inflation hedge and store-of-value narratives in the market after falling 72% from ATHs.\nAs demand for blockspace falls, Bitcoin transaction count and transaction fees have fallen 3% and 23%, respectively. Average daily value settled declined 44% QoQ.\nDue to steep increases in energy prices, all-time-highs in hashrate, falling bitcoin prices, and lower transaction fees, miners found themselves in an increasingly difficult position.\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) raised concerns on how Proof-of-Work could hinder U.S. efforts to combat climate change and how energy-intensive mining could negatively affect electricity grid reliability and prices.\nDespite criticizing Proof-of-Work, the OSTP’s report highlights how Bitcoin mining can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help accelerate the transition to a renewable grid.\n\nPrimer on Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin is the first distributed consensus-based, censorship-resistant, permissionless, peer-to-peer payment settlement network. Bitcoin (BTC), the native asset of the Bitcoin blockchain, is the world\'s first digital currency without a central bank or administrator. Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin has a predictable, stable monetary policy that operates autonomously, giving it the ideal store-of-value properties. To secure its network, Bitcoin uses a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Work (PoW) to solve the “double-spend problem.” PoW requires participants (miners) to contribute computing power to solve arbitrary mathematical puzzles in order to add a new block to the blockchain. Bitcoin is awarded to the miner who solves the puzzle first, thus minting new bitcoins.\n\n“Bitcoin is like a mirror, its hottest narrative reflecting what society most needs” -Chris Burniske\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nQuarter Highlights\n\nThe latest market crash has been a narrative breaker and reality check for the top cryptoasset.\n\nInflation hedge — With its fixed supply and hardened monetary policy, the narrative goes that bitcoin should act as a hedge against inflation. Instead, bitcoin has made new cycle lows even as the CPI inflation in the U.S. hit multi-decade highs.\nStore of value — Since hitting an all-time-high of $69,000 in November 2021, bitcoin has fallen 72% amidst a risk-off macro environment. Instead of a store of value, the price action has been similar to that of a high-beta U.S. tech equity. Bitcoin price suffered as the Federal Reserve turned to a more conservative regime with lower liquidity and higher rates.\nBear asset outperformer — Even in the throes of a bear market, the top coin lost market cap dominance. The primary reason was Ethereum’s outperformance as it progressed towards its transition to Proof-of-Stake.\nMaturing institutional asset with lower volatility — Many institutions capitulated, with Tesla most notably selling most of its bitcoin in Q2 of 2022. Capitulation from large lending platforms and funds further contributed to the volatility. As such, the asset has yet to “mature” to a lower risk spectrum, even though <a href="https://messari.io/report/the-institutions-are-finally-coming">some institutions</a> did come.\n\nOver 70% drawdowns are hardly new for Bitcoin and its holders. Bitcoin has been known to rise from the ashes. While user and transaction growth may be hard to find, activity did not fall as much as price. With price at multi-year lows, the tourists have left, but the network continues to chug along. The bear market is the time for builders to build and believers to accumulate.\n\n“Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.”\n\nMarket Metrics\n\nBitcoin returns have increasingly correlated with U.S. tech stocks since the liquidity-fueled bull market ended in late 2021. For the quarter, the average correlation between Bitcoin and NASDAQ 100 was 0.6 as inflation and rate hikes dominated the narrative. Surprisingly, digital gold and physical gold are far less correlated. The average correlation for the quarter between the two assets was 0.2.\n\nBitcoin realized volatility trended downwards as it made a gradual recovery in Q3. Average 30-day volatility for August was 60% compared to over 80% for June. Lower bitcoin volatility resulted in lower liquidations for the broad crypto market. The total long liquidations in August were $5 billion, less than half of that in June ($10.8 billion). Total short liquidations were significantly lower as well, $3.5 billion in August compared to $6.6 billion in June.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nDaily transactions for the network have remained largely unchanged for the whole year, averaging around 250,000 per day. Average transaction fees have been very low since the first bull run of 2021. Quarter to date, the average fee per transaction was only $1.4, down 21% for the quarter and 55% for the year.\n\nThe last fee spike occurred in early 2021 when bitcoin’s price made new highs. Typically during bull runs, users are willing to pay higher fees to make sure their transactions are included as early as possible.\n\nGrowth in funded addresses slowed for the network. During Q3, funded addresses only grew by 1.1% compared to 2.5% in Q2 2022. On a monthly time frame, the number of funded addresses experienced its first decline in August 2022 after 10 months of consistent growth.\n\nAverage daily active addresses at 890,000 were down 4% compared to Q2 2022. Active addresses seem to have returned to their baseline of activity, after the cycle peaked in Q4 2021 along with the prices. Some of the activity also moved onto Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network, also explaining the fall in fees.\n\nLightning Network\n\nThe Lightning Network (LN) is a Layer-2 payment channel network anchored to the Bitcoin protocol. It intends to increase the network’s throughput while decreasing transaction settlement time. First introduced in 2015, Lightning\'s scaling approach has gained popularity over time and is now considered to be the de facto scaling solution for Bitcoin.\n\nThe LN has been in its own siloed bull market over the past year, insulated from the overall market downturn. As token prices fall, network usage and activity tend to follow. However,  LN\'s key metrics have steadily grown, despite bitcoin’s price dropping 57% over the past year.\n\nAdditionally, Lightning’s adoption increased as the <a href="https://messari.io/report/what-s-happening-on-the-lightning-network">technical foundation of the network reached maturity</a>. Many companies have built the tools and services needed for Bitcoin and LN to reach mainstream adoption. Voltage, for example, provides easy-to-use hosting services for Bitcoin and Lightning nodes on the cloud.\n\nThe bitcoin capacity held in public channels on the LN reached a new high of 4,618 bitcoin valued at $93 million. The combination of the increase in adoption and integrations led to capacity drastically increasing by 96% in the past year. Some of the companies that adopted Lightning in 2022 are Cash App, Kraken, BitPay, and Robinhood.\n\nLightning channel and node counts have also grown steadily, increasing 24% and 14% YoY, respectively. This growth indicates that the LN is moving away from a hobbyist network towards being a <a href="https://messari.io/report/what-s-happening-on-the-lightning-network">mature financial payment network</a>.\n\nMining\n\n2021 was an exceptional year for Bitcoin miners. Virtually all mining operations became profitable as Bitcoin\'s price rose faster than the network\'s hashrate. During the 2021 bull market, many mining companies took advantage of rising bitcoin prices by raising capital through the issuance of new equity and debt in order to grow their operations. Public mining stocks exploded upwards alongside Bitcoin. However, the broader macro environment caused the euphoria to come to an abrupt halt in 2022.\n\nThe biggest expense for Bitcoin miners is their cost of energy. Just this year, energy prices across the United States increased 15% YoY. With energy prices rising globally, many miners found themselves under pressure, especially those without power purchase agreements (PPAs) in place.\n\nGoing into 2022, there was roughly $5 billion worth of outstanding ASIC purchase orders set to be delivered to public miners. As bitcoin’s price trended downwards, miners began plugging in new ASICs as they arrived in order to begin getting paid back. This pushed the network’s hashrate and difficulty upwards. As hashrate and energy prices increased while bitcoin price decreased, miners found themselves in an increasingly difficult position. Many public miners resorted to selling bitcoin to continue financing their operations and service their debts. Miners selling bitcoin instead of HODLing added to the downward price pressure.\n\nMiner Revenue\n\nMiners have two sources of revenue: block rewards and transaction fees. Their revenue is determined by bitcoin\'s price and demand for Bitcoin blockspace. In Q4 2021, miner revenue peaked at $4.8 billion, but it has been declining alongside the price of bitcoin ever since. Quarterly revenue for miners in Q1 2022 and Q2 2022 declined 28% and 22%, respectively. In the event that Bitcoin’s price remains range-bound through the end of Q3, quarterly miner revenue will likely continue the downward trend given the high energy prices.\n\nBitcoin’s block rewards make up the majority of miner revenue. This quarter, total miner revenue derived from fees was 1.7%. Although the fee level is up 0.1% from last quarter, it is significantly lower than the fees miners earned during the 2021 bull market. Currently, low fees are not a big issue because miners are more incentivized by block subsidies than fees to secure the network. However, Bitcoin\'s long-term security could be at risk if these low fees persist as the block subsidy approaches zero.\n\nHashrate\n\nIn May 2021, China’s ban on Bitcoin mining resulted in a 50% rapid decline in hashrate. Two months later, hashrate began to increase after mining machines exported from China were turned back on. By December, the network’s hashrate had completely recovered to pre-May levels.\n\nIn June 2022, hashrate began declining as energy prices continued increasing, leading some miners to unplug their machines. Due to the continued delivery of ASICs to miners who ordered them back in 2021, the hashrate is now near its all-time-high. As hashrate increases during a declining bitcoin price period, miners may be forced to divert from their HODL strategy and sell bitcoin held on their balance sheet.\n\nAlthough China’s mining ban negatively impacted Bitcoin’s hashrate and price initially, it ended up benefiting the network. Prior to the ban, Chinese miners had the dominant portion of the network’s hashrate on a country-by-country basis. After the ban, Chinese mining operations migrated to countries like the U.S., Kazakhstan, and Canada where there was less regulatory uncertainty. As a result, the Bitcoin network became more decentralized and resilient, avoiding the geopolitical risk of one country having an outsized portion of the hashrate.\n\nThe U.S. total hashrate increased from 16% in May 2021 to 38% in January 2022. U.S. mining pools also benefited from China\'s mining ban, with Foundry USA becoming the largest pool. As of August 31, 2022, the Foundry USA pool has 24% of the network’s hashrate, up 180% YoY.\n\nEnergy Consumption\n\nIt is nearly impossible to determine the exact electricity consumption of the Bitcoin network due to its decentralized nature. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance (CCAF) uses a real-time model to estimate the Bitcoin network’s daily electric load within a hypothetical range.\n\nCompared to Q2 2022, estimated energy consumption only increased 2% while hashrate increased 6% and reached a new all-time-high. The decoupling could be attributed to newer ASICs coming online, which are more energy efficient and have a higher hashing rate.\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nThe HODL wave categorizes Bitcoin unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) by when they last moved on-chain. Short-term holders (under 6 months) are at a multi-year low and own just 23% of the Bitcoin supply as of August 31. Over the last 7 years, Bitcoin’s short-term holders have bottomed six times, with the following year always yielding positive returns.\n\nThe number of short-term holders has historically been a leading indicator of bitcoin price peaks. As bitcoin starts making new highs, it gets into the news cycle and attracts more buyers. However, the last peak in November 2021 did not attract new investors in the same way, perhaps due to macroenvironmental factors.\n\nThe market cap to realized value ratio (MVRV) compares the current market cap to the price of Bitcoin when they last moved for all circulating BTC. As such, it shows the cumulative degree of profitability of the holders.\n\nAt the end of August, the MVRV fell below the key level of 1, implying that holders are at a loss on aggregate. Disposition effect in behavioral finance suggests that investors hold onto their loss-making investments in hopes of turning them into winners. Therefore, an MVRV below 1 is a zone of accumulation for long-term investors.\n\nGoogle search trends help reinforce the idea that not many new entrants entered in the last cycle. Typically, the number of Google searches declines with the fall in BTC’s price. However, Bitcoin has had lower highs in searches since 2017. On top of that, the second bull run of 2021 had only half the search interest as the first. The decoupling between Google search trends and BTC’s price could indicate that fewer newcomers are entering the space.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nRegulation\n\nPoW\n\nWith rising energy prices and climate change becoming an increasingly important political issue, Bitcoin\'s energy consumption and environmental impact have come under increased scrutiny. On September 8, 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published a report on crypto mining\'s climate and energy implications in response to President Biden’s executive order. In general, the report raises concerns on how Proof-of-Work could hinder U.S. efforts to combat climate change and how energy-intensive mining could negatively affect electricity grid reliability and prices.\n\nThe report calls on several federal agencies to develop standards that minimize negative environmental impact and ensure energy reliability. If these measures prove ineffective, the report states that Congress and the Administration should explore limiting or eliminating PoW mining.\n\nDespite the White House’s criticism of PoW mining, the report does mention how PoW mining can yield positive results for the climate through alternative mining operations. Additionally, the report states that PoW mining can accelerate the transition to a renewable grid by contributing to needed rapid demand-response services and providing additional revenue to renewable developers.\n\nTexas has served as an excellent case study in validating both positive PoW impacts identified in the White House’s report, due to the state’s business-friendly stance towards mining. But not all states have been as friendly towards PoW mining as Texas. Back in June 2022, the New York Senate passed a bill placing a two-year moratorium on new PoW mining operations using fossil fuels. The bill has yet to be signed by New York’s governor, but it is expected to pass.\n\nOutside of the U.S., the European Union has been working on its own set of regulations known as Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA). Introduced in 2020, the legislation aimed to create legislation for governing crypto assets. The initial draft included a proposal to ban crypto services from using PoW-based cryptoassets. However, this proposal was voted down by lawmakers in March 2022. In June 2022, EU lawmakers and members finalized the regulatory framework after excluding the proposal to ban PoW mining.\n\nRegulatory Oversight\n\nOver the last several years, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have been at odds over who should have jurisdiction over the crypto industry. In August 2022, the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act was introduced to the U.S. Senate which would give the CFTC direct regulatory oversight over bitcoin’s and ether’s spot market.\n\nEarly in September 2022, Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, signaled his support for handing the CFTC authority over non-security tokens such as bitcoin. The move potentially opens up the regulatory path for a Bitcoin spot ETF and the possibility of eliminating the <a href="https://messari.io/report/the-grayscale-gensler-stalemate">problematic GBTC discount</a>.\n\nESG\n\nFrom an ESG perspective, Bitcoin mining appears to be troublesome. Bitcoin mining consumes a significant amount of energy and generates a carbon footprint approximately half that of the data center sector. However, as stated in the White House’s mining report,  mining can, under the right circumstances, <a href="https://messari.io/report/how-bitcoin-is-improving-the-environment?referrer=asset:bitcoin">reduce greenhouse gas emissions</a> and accelerate the transition to a renewable grid.\n\nEven with the benefits observed from Bitcoin mining, the industry is still pushing towards a more sustainable energy mix. The Bitcoin Mining Council (BMC), a voluntary global forum of miners, has been working to bring transparency and best practices to the mining industry since June 2021. The BMC consists of 45 mining companies from five countries representing 50.5% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. In its Q2 report, the BMC reported that the global Bitcoin mining network had a 59.5% sustainable (carbon neutral) power mix. Compared to countries, Bitcoin has the largest sustainable power mix, with the runner up being Germany at 48.5%.\n\nAccording to the BMC, the network’s sustainable power mix has increased 62% in the last 18 months due to increased reliance on renewable energy. BMC data, however, is under scrutiny as it is based on self-reporting by miners. To confirm the network’s progression toward more renewable energy, Daniel Batten performed an independent analysis using publicly available information. He found that in the past 18 months, there was a 10.9% minimum increase in the network’s sustainable energy mix, suggesting that the network is moving in the right direction.\n\nCarbon-Negative Energy Sources\n\nWhile the BMC quantifies the carbon-neutral portion of the network, it has not evaluated the carbon-negative power sources. Batten found that 2.36% of the network is powered by carbon-negative sources. Bitcoin miners use natural gas that would have otherwise been flared by the oil and gas industry. When Bitcoin miners combust the gas rather than it being released as methane into the atmosphere, they reduce the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by 63%. As a result, the 2.36% of carbon-negative energy sources end up lowering the carbon-intensity of the network by 4.02%.\n\nCoinShares estimates that 69 TWh of wasted power in the U.S. is lost annually to flaring, which results in a carbon footprint of 78 million tons of CO2e emissions. In other words, the wasted energy from flaring in the U.S. is equal to 78% of the energy used by the global Bitcoin network in 2021 (89 TWh). Repurposing flared energy towards Bitcoin mining would drastically reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses entering the atmosphere — enough to potentially offset all the network’s CO2e emissions or even make it carbon negative.\n\nProtocol and Ecosystem Development\n\nBear markets are for building. Contrary to popular belief, there is a lot of development going on in the ecosystem:\n\nBIP-119 aims to give users more control over how bitcoin is spent.\nBIP-300 and 301 aim to expand Bitcoin’s functionality with opt-in sidechains without altering the base layer. The proposals could bring smart contracts to Bitcoin and provide a feasible way to sustain the protocol through transaction fees.\nTaro is a new Taproot-powered protocol introduced by Lightning Labs. It aims to bring stablecoins and other assets onto the Lightning Network.\n<a href="https://messari.io/report/earning-yield-on-bitcoin-with-lightning?referrer=asset:bitcoin">Lightning Pool and Magma</a> have made it possible to generate yield on Bitcoin in a noncustodial way.\n\nDuring the quarter, multiple developers left their roles maintaining Bitcoin Core. In July, Peter Wuille announced that he is scaling back his contributions. In August, Wladamir van der Laan, longest-serving Lead Maintainer for Bitcoin Core, announced his resignation.\n\nSmart Contract Capability\n\nBitcoin’s functionality is limited by design to reduce the surface area for potential vulnerabilities. While Bitcoin does have smart contract capability, it is not Turing complete, meaning it doesn’t allow for logical loops. Instead of altering the Bitcoin base layer and sacrificing security for programmability, one option for bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin is using a Layer-1 blockchain with a native bridge to Bitcoin.\n\nStacks is a Layer-1 blockchain that enables developers to write smart contracts that benefit from Bitcoin’s security. It uses Clarity, a decidable programming language, to read and react to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Stacks uses a novel consensus mechanism known as proof-of-transfer (PoX) to secure its blockchain. PoX recycles Bitcoin’s PoW, allowing it to benefit from its decentralization without any additional environmental impact.\n\nKey Events\n\nJuly\n\nTesla sells 75% of the bitcoin on its balance sheet at a loss.\nThe Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act is introduced, aiming to make bitcoin transactions up to $50 tax exempt.\n\nAugust\n\nBlackRock launches a spot bitcoin private trust for institutional clients.\nNew York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG) announces a Lightning accelerator project geared towards developers working on Lightning, Taro, and covenants.\nIran passes legislation establishing a framework for bitcoin to be used as payment for imports.\n\nSeptember\n\nFidelity Investments plans to allow individual investors to trade bitcoin on its brokerage platform.\nRussia’s Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Russia have reconsidered their position towards cryptoassets and acknowledge that it is necessary to legalize them for cross-border settlements.\nMicroStrategy files with the SEC to sell up to $500 million in stock to buy more bitcoin.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nDuring Q3’22, several Bitcoin narratives failed to hold up. Over the year, BTC wasn’t a hedge against inflation or a store of value. Additionally, on-chain metrics showed a slow down in transactions, new users, and active users. However, development activity and usage in off-chain Bitcoin ecosystems such as Lightning and Stacks significantly increased.\n\nOn the mining front, a dark cloud looms over the industry as energy prices and inflation continue to increase in the low-liquidity macro environment. In addition, with hashrate hitting all-time-highs and the bitcoin price struggling to stay above $20,000, miner revenues are approaching unprofitable levels. If bitcoin’s price remains range-bound or declines further, some miners and companies will be forced to sell additional bitcoin to service debt payments and operational expenses.\n\nWith that said, Bitcoin has survived much worse throughout its history. Eventually, new narratives are likely to emerge to replace the old ones. Developers are building to bring new functionality to the protocol and smart contracts to Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining could also become a way to fight climate change by reducing emissions and strengthening the grid. With how unpredictable Bitcoin can be, it\'s possible that the next cycle could be driven by the narrative of bitcoin as an ESG asset.',

      title: "Bridging BTC to Harmony's Ethereum Virtual Machine",
      content:
        'Key Insights\n\nHarmony has developed a trustless BTC-to-Harmony bridge leveraging XCLAIM as the design framework. The bridge is most closely associated with the light client and relay model as defined by Dmitriy Berenzon.\nBTC is locked in Vaults on the Bitcoin network, with Vault Operators providing collateral in the form of the ONE token. Relayers, who monitor the Vaults for transactions, must also provide ONE collateral.\nFee payments are made to both Relayers and Vault Operators, encouraging broad participation from different entities. Both Relayers and Vault Operators may be slashed if they fail to meet their Service Level Agreements (SLAs).\nIn the future, there is potential for a new token to govern the bridge and its parameters.\n\nWith the release of Harmony’s new trustless BTC bridge comes another opportunity for BTC HODLers to put their BTC to work and participate in DeFi without liquidating any precious SATS.\n\nSmart contracts are extremely difficult to build with Bitcoin Script as it is intentionally more limited to make Bitcoin a more secure and resilient network. Ethereum, on the other hand, came along and made tradeoffs to achieve greater smart contract functionality and Turing completeness, which is why application development and DeFi originally blossomed there, but also why contract exploits are prevalent. ‘Turing completeness’ means that it is theoretically possible to create anything within that system, as long as it can be broken down into logical steps. Smart contracts and the sprawling world of Web3 are an example of this: where we are limited only by our imaginations (and making these bits of code gas efficient). Since Bitcoin does not have smart contracts, it is more challenging to create conditioned and complex transactions. This makes the custody of bitcoin programmatic, and bridging it to other blockchains trustlessly becomes quite a tall task. Today, the vast majority of BTC used on other chains is via centralized custodians.\n\nThis report will examine a trustless BTC bridge, called the Harmony BTC bridge — a new product within the Harmony ecosystem. It is designed to be secure and completely trustless. The bridge operation, economics, and risks will be evaluated as well as the implications of BTC functioning on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network.\n\nA Quick Primer on Harmony\n\nHarmony is a sharded, fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain that utilizes an innovative consensus mechanism called Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS). Unlike ‘traditional’ PoS, in which the right to validate the next block is awarded via lottery or bidding, EPoS encourages decentralization by introducing a non-linear relationship between the number of tokens staked and the chances of mining the next block. In other words, more tokens staked does not equal more rewards. Thus, stakers cannot harness economies of scale.\n\nThis mechanism has been explained more in depth by the Harmony team and <a href="https://messari.io/article/at-one-with-harmony">previous Messari research</a>.\n\nHarmony is also home to a burgeoning DeFi ecosystem, with TVL increasing more than four-fold in the past two months to reach over $1 billion. The majority of the TVL (60%) comes from game/DEX/NFT marketplace DeFi Kingdoms. The next biggest application by TVL is Tranquil Finance, commanding nearly $500 million.\n\nBridges Walked So Alts Could Run\n\nThroughout 2021, the rise of L2s and many alternate L1s with liquidity incentives has signaled that mercenary capital has moved from and across chains. Over $25 billion in value bridged across Ethereum is a testament to this.\n\nBridges facilitate the movement of capital. Different chains are better suited for different uses, and bridges help them become interoperable. Different protocols have different rules and standards, which means tokens you can use on one chain are not usable on another. Bridges allow the use of tokens on new chains. This is achieved via "wrapping," where a token is burned or locked in escrow on one chain, and an equivalent, "wrapped" token is issued on the new chain.\n\nThus, if Bob has 10 tokens on the blue blockchain and wishes to move three to the red blockchain, he can lock three of the tokens on the blue blockchain and mint three wrapped tokens on the red blockchain. Bob still has 10 tokens; it\'s just that three are now wrapped and can be used in a new environment.\n\nHarmoniously Bridging BTC\n\nThe Harmony BTC bridge enables the wrapping of BTC for use on the EVM-compatible Harmony blockchain. Bridging Bitcoin and Harmony has potentially significant implications for the Harmony ecosystem: BTC is a massive asset, with an average market cap of just under $1 trillion over the last six months. If it can be deployed on another chain for yield and other uses, it may mean considerable increases in TVL and network activity.\n\nActivity and use of blockchains are the whole raison d’etre after all; increased usage and the growth of the network is therefore a tremendous victory for any protocol.\n\nAt the time of writing, Harmony TVL stands at over a billion in USD terms. The ability to bridge over an asset worth ~$1 trillion could substantially increase TVL and the value of the Harmony network.\n\nWhat must be mentioned is that a secure bridge to Harmony is a win for all EVM chains and BTC holders. The use of the Ethereum Virtual Machine is, in effect, a standard that many different chains use. This universality dramatically reduces the complexity of using bitcoin on other EVM chains, as sharing standards make bridging tokens easier.\n\nSubsequently, bitcoin HODLers may also benefit from opportunities that lie beyond Harmony, exploring new pastures on other chains as well.\n\nOne of the main reasons bitcoin HODLers may not wish to use BTC anywhere else is because they do not wish to take on any counterparty risk, and many existing bridges do not operate in a truly trustless way. After all, one of the main theses behind the creation of Bitcoin is the elimination of trust and reliance on third parties. Trustless bridges aim to eliminate these concerns and enable the use of BTC in smart contracts without sacrificing any of the decentralized cypherpunk ethos.\n\nOn paper, the economic incentives of the Harmony BTC bridge do mean it is trustless. Should this be achieved in practice as well as theory, this bridge could be the decentralized gateway for BTC into the EVM world.\n\nAccording to DeFiPulse, the only trustless BTC bridge is tBTC. However, of the ~330,000 BTC deployed on other chains, 79% is done through the custodial wBTC.\n\nSource: DeFi Pulse\n\nRepresenting this data depends upon an awareness of all active BTC bridges and discerning which UTXOs are locked in various vaults or pools to back bridged coins. However, this is not always possible, as represented by Shinobi, the bridge to Secret Network. The actual number of BTC active on other chains may be higher than reported.\n\nSince bitcoin can be deployed on Harmony, many users may be attracted as the Big Orange Coin can now be deployed for yield on various DeFi protocols.\n\nWhen on Harmony, BTC is represented as 1BTC.\n\nThey are not inherently of equal value. No algorithmic price peg is used; it is simply a supply peg. This means that BTC can always be redeemed 1:1 with 1BTC (plus fees) and vice versa regardless of any price premiums. Thus, game theory dictates that the market will keep the peg by arbitraging any differences.\n\nHow Does the Bridge Work?\n\nOn a very high level, BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain is first locked in a vault. This transaction is verified in a trustless manner through a relayer and enables the minting of 1BTC on the Harmony blockchain. On the way back, the 1BTC is burned - which is verified and gives the right to redeem the originally locked BTC from the vault on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nThe XCLAIM protocol is used as a framework for the bridge. It is a protocol that defines functions for wrapped tokens backed by assets on the original chain. Further information on the protocol and its inner workings can be found here.\n\nWhen BTC is being bridged, it is locked in vaults on the Bitcoin blockchain, and coins are stored until being redeemed. Thus, they act as backing for the newly issued 1BTC and give it its value.\n\nAnyone is supposed to be able to operate a vault should they wish: the process involves registering the vault and running a vault client. This is designed to be easy and profitable to attract more vaults and improve decentralization.\n\nIn order for the bridge to be trustless, the vault operators are required to post collateral in the form of ONE tokens - the collateral required is currently 150%. This ensures that they have a strong enough disincentive to run away with the BTC. If BTC is spent without authorization, or the vault goes offline and cannot provide service temporarily, punishments are enacted.\n\nRelayers monitor the vaults to see if any unauthorized transactions take place. They also monitor the Bitcoin blockchain for proof that UTXOs have been locked in a vault. They store BTC block headers on Harmony and enable the 1BTC issuing contract to see whether an issuer has made the transaction they claim to have made on the BTC blockchain. Relayers, like Vaults, must post collateral in ONE that is liable to be slashed in the event of malicious behavior.\n\nFees are paid to both of these types of actors to incentivize participation from a network of actors to avoid having just one Relayer and Vault operated by the Harmony team. Trustlessness may only be achieved through decentralization after all.\n\nAn oracle is used to determine the price of ONE relative to BTC. This is how the 150% collateral required is monitored. Currently, this source of information is the only component that is not decentralized — the bridge assumes that the oracle is trustworthy. However, the Chainlink integration is now implemented, and the source of price feeds will now be as decentralized as the Chainlink network.\n\nAccording to the Harmony team, further steps are being taken to mitigate price feed risk. The staked relayers can also submit price feeds used to benchmark the oracle price and determine whether there is a difference between them that is greater than 0.5%. If price fluctuations between two price feeds are greater than 10%, additional measures are taken.\n\nDescribing the bridge with a practical example:\n\nBob wishes to use his BTC for yield farming on the Harmony blockchain.\n\nBob selects a vault, sends his BTC to it, and includes his Harmony address.\nOnce this transaction is verified, a relayer submits proof of inclusion in the Bitcoin block to the Harmony chain.\nThis proof allows Bob to mint 1BTC, which is sent to the Harmony address he submitted with the BTC transaction.\nBob can now use his newly issued 1BTC to obtain attractive yields.\n\nThe Economics\n\nIf vaults go offline or fail to provide users service, they are slashed between 10% and 30%. The severity of the punishment is determined by each actor\'s score, or SLA (Service Level Agreements). The SLA is a number between 0 and 100. The score is increased by good behaviors and service and reduced by subpar performance and crashes. The higher score a vault has, the higher rewards it receives, and the less it is penalized if it fails to provide service. Both Vaults and Relayers have SLAs.\n\nThe reasoning for this is because extreme punishments for first-time offenders may deter actors from participating as vaults. Hence, this reputation system is used to give vault operators a history and credibility they can use to escape hefty fines should they fail for any reason beyond their control.  If Vaults fail to provide adequate service, their collateral is awarded to the depositor who has lost their BTC. If Relayers are slashed, the tokens are sent to the fee pool.\n\nThese fees are distributed to incentivize the vault operators and Staked Relayers to provide this essential service that allows the bridge to operate in a trustless manner.\n\nSource:  BTC Bridge Specs — Fee Model\n\nUsers pay a fee of 0.5% for using the bridge and minting/redeeming 1BTC — paid in 1BTC. These fees are paid to fee pools, and distributed across Relayers and Vaults according to their SLA. Furthermore, direct fees are paid to Vaults and Relayers directly for their service. There is also a security deposit paid, regardless of the amount bridged, that is equal to 0.5% of the amount of collateral required to back the requested BTC transfer. In addition, all slashed stakes (penalties for downtime/bad service) are also sent to these pools.\n\nEssentially, using a permissionless network of vaults and relayers means that the bridge can operate in a truly censorship-resistant way. The fee model is the final puzzle piece that makes the bridge work. If all stakeholders act according to game theory, and if there are enough stakeholders to make it sybil resistant, the bridge would function as planned.\n\nFuture Plans\n\nAs with many projects, certain aspects of the project are fixed initially, and the team reserves control over them to remain agile and make quick decisions. Future plans and developments revolve around the economics and the governance and control of the bridge.\n\nEconomics\n\nThe current security deposit fee for locking BTC in a vault is a single ONE token. This could change to be a percentage of the vault’s collateral.\nMove to a fee market instead of the fixed 0.5% fees for minting and redeeming.\n\nGovernance\n\nThere are plans to introduce a token in a future release.\nThis will likely be used for decentralized governance of the bridge and its specs/fees.\nThe release of a token will also probably lead to revised tokeneconomics.\n\nRisks\n\nAs laid forth in an excellent Medium article by Dmitriy Berenzon: there are three main categories of bridges. Any given bridge can fall into one of the classifications or combine elements of each.\n\nSource: Dmitriy Berenzon\n\nThe 1BTC bridge is one of light clients and relays. As can be seen on the above graph, it excels in capital efficiency, statefulness, and security. The economic incentives of the bridge ensure that the federation of Staked Relayers maintains connectivity and statefulness. In addition, Vaults are incentivized to provide timely service.\n\nHowever, two areas of weakness are capital (in)efficiency and security.\n\nCapital Efficiency\n\nThe staked tokens by Relayers and Vaults and the BTC collateral posted by users is just that: fixed capital that sits there hostage to disincentivize antisocial behavior. Although a robust mechanism that aligns incentives, this capital is not used for liquidity or put to work in any way.\n\nCapital inefficiency is not exactly a sin; it just means that the utilization of resources could be more efficient. In addition to that, it could hamper scalability, as collateral must increase proportionally with value bridged. Since the collateral required to bridge BTC is 150%, the amount held in vaults must always be 10% greater than 1BTC in existence. Of course, these are design tradeoffs made in the name of speed and aligned economic incentives.\n\nSecurity\n\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In the world of crypto and blockchain, this usually translates to the layer of the stack that is most centralized. In the case of the bridge, it is the reliance on the price oracle whose trustworthiness is assumed.\n\nThis oracle dictates the price of ONE/BTC. Since ONE is the collateral used by Vaults and Relayers, the price dropping below a certain threshold relative to BTC can trigger liquidations/slashing. Theoretically, should the oracle be manipulated (a common exploit) to give false prices, these conditions may be falsely met.\n\nChainlink Oracles have now been integrated and will provide a price feed not dependent upon a single oracle. Thus, the oracle risk will be mitigated by making this link of the chain as censorship resistant as Chainlink’s network.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nUltimately, the Harmony BTC bridge uses a network of vaults and relayers. The architecture is decentralized in theory, but it is yet to be seen whether the existing incentives are enough to galvanize different actors into participation to achieve decentralization.\n\nThe merits, design risks, and the undeniable importance of bridges have been examined. The multichain world is not an idea; it is a reality. Different chains are optimized for different purposes. Numerous blockchains today boast impressive activity and value locked. However, issues arise due to clashing ideologies, standards, and the fragmentation of liquidity and information.\n\nThe future of dapps and UX is not one where users manually select which chain to transact on; it is one where users are unaware of which underlying blockchain is being used to interact with Web3. Users may even be using multiple simultaneously — one for verification, another to sign transactions, and yet another for settlement with finality.\n\nFrictionless bridges and communication between blockchains can enable this vision of the not-so-distant future. The continuing development and decentralization of these services are vital to an internet run on blockchains. The new Harmony–Bitcoin bridge is another step towards this future, where information and value are seamlessly and trustlessly interoperable across chains.\n\nThis report was commissioned by Harmony, a member of Protocol Services.

      title: "2Q'21 Currency Sector Recap",
      content:
        'The 2Q’21 was a tale of two halves in one of the most eventful quarters of the Currency sector’s history.\n\nThe first half of the quarter was full of jubilations as Coinbase (COIN) employees popped champagne during the company\'s direct listing on April 14, 2021. Bitcoin reached all time highs (ATHs) of over $60,000, and there were more eyes on crypto than ever before. Institutional investors and banks moved to announce their involvement in the digital assets sphere, pouring equity capital and launching new initiatives to get their clients onboard. Even State Street, the second oldest bank in the US with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, announced it will be building a crypto trading platform.\n\nWe also saw speculative mania of DOGE reaching <a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">$0.74</a> on the back of Elon posing as the Dogefather on Saturday Night Live (SNL). ASS, SHIBA and CUMMIES also saw the limelight, though meme coins rarely warrant mainstream media attention. Mark Zuckerberg even announced the names of his two goats, Max and Bitcoin, perhaps hinting to the world that he’s a Bitcoin maximalist.\n\nBitcoin 2Q’21\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s price rallied +10% in the first part of April, its price ended the month down by -9%. The sudden drop in value should’ve raised a few red flags but markets ignored warning signs of a major reversal or market fatigue since Bitcoin had seen six consecutive positive months, a first since 2012. In retrospect, there were indeed signs of market fatigue. The COIN direct listing saw the price collapse by -20% in the first days of trading, and Tesla also announced it had sold 10% of their Bitcoin position for treasury management reasons. Nevertheless, all indications still pointed to a bull run as the remainder of the crypto market diverged from Bitcoin’s price performance. In April, <a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum">ETH</a> was up +44%, DOGE continued its winning streak up +463%, and even late-cycle <a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic">ETC</a> was up 146%.\n\nIn mid-May, Bitcoin’s price began to reverse seeing the largest reversal as its third-worst performing month in history, down -38%. This finally ended narratives that this rally was just like the 2017 bull market.\n\nIt wasn’t even like the 2013 bull market either, as investors found themselves in uncharted waters. Never before had a four-year cyclical top been so tame and never before had a mid-bull run reversal been so severe.\n\nThe month of May also brought an onslaught of sequential negative news events in a FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) bath. Market participants began to wonder if this attack on Bitcoin was coordinated. Negative news included Tesla ceasing to accept Bitcoin for purchases, citing Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) concerns. This resulted in mainstream media frequently reporting on Bitcoin’s coal usage and impact on global warming. Even the Pope commented on the detriments of technology based on “highly polluting fossil fuels”. Most importantly, Tesla’s announcement sparked Elon Musk’s damaging verbal diarrhea on Bitcoin, even after agreeing that Bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy.\n\nSource: Travis Kling\n\nMany valid ESG rebuttals (here, here, here, and here) were provided but were largely ignored by mainstream media. Michael Saylor even championed a North American Bitcoin Mining Council to collect renewable usage data. As soon as it seemed that Bitcoin was heading in the right direction with ESG, the public outcry ceased by mid-June, as quickly as it started. The Bitcoin ESG FUD would be shelved for another day. For Q2’21, the Bitcoin Mining Council reported that the Bitcoin Mining energy usage only amounted to 0.12% of the World’s total energy consumption.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Mining Council\n\nIn the US, the sector also saw one of the busiest months of regulatory headwinds. The US Senate Banking Committee urged the new Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Head to review past favorable crypto rulings and the OCC, FDIC and the Fed was reportedly in talks about an interagency crypto policy team. The FDIC, in its capacity as a federal banking regulator, was issuing requests for information from banks on crypto usage. The IRS was reportedly cracking down on crypto tax evasion. The IRS was also, along with the US Justice Department, investigating the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Additionally, New York State introduced a Senate Bill to halt Bitcoin mining for three years while it assessed the environmental impact. The Treasury called for crypto transfers above $10,000 to be reported to the IRS. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called the US crypto regulatory framework inadequate and pushed for a new framework and SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated greater investor protection is needed on crypto exchanges. Most damaging of all could have been the slew of fake news and unsubstantiated claims.\n\nSeparately, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin could have meant that <a href="https://messari.io/article/macro-update-on-bubbles-taper-tantrums">macroeconomics played a role</a> in this selldown. On May 12 2021, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) printed +4.2%,the highest inflation print since September 2008. In light of signs of overheating in the market, though mitigated by bad jobs numbers, the Fed’s meeting minutes hinted that they were beginning to think about, thinking about tapering. This led to a knee jerk reaction of US real yields rising +9bps though traditional financial markets remained relatively calm. Markets already knew that inflation numbers were high due to a low base effect from COVID-19. However, Bitcoin, at the extreme end of the risk curve for traditional institutional investors, saw a major selldown. The month after, the CPI print of 5% was even higher but it didn’t warrant a market reaction. As expected, the Fed will patiently wait for economic data to decide if they will bring forth tapering from the expected Q1’22E. Concerns of tapering subsided, but Bitcoin’s price failed to recover.\n\nIn China, the Vice Premier Liu announced a crackdown specifically on crypto mining and trading. It was nothing new -- China had banned securities companies from engaging in Bitcoin since 2013, and also banned trading in 2017. However, never before had the announcement come from someone so senior in the China Communist Party, the chair of the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee. And never before had Bitcoin mining and trading been specifically stated. The government newspaper, Xinhua, also published articles citing a series of crypto-related scams, with 1,100 people arrested for money laundering through crypto. Reasons cited by the public focus on social stability, especially important before the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary on July 1.\n\nThis resulted in Chinese search engine Baidu removing Binance, Huobi and OKEx. Weibo, a prominent social media platform, blocked major exchanges and key opinion leaders. <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">BTC </a>market data was also removed from security trading platforms like Tencent-backed Futu and Tiger Securities. Additionally, companies highlighted that their plans to launch crypto trading services would target non-China domiciled clients. Major crypto exchanges Huobi and OKEx scaled back on leveraged trading, from a maximum of 125x to less than 5x. Furthermore, new clients wouldn’t have access to the leverage trading function.\n\nSource: WuBlockchain\n\nOn the mining front, the Inner Mongolia region was the first to comply, followed by more important regions such as Xinjian, the most important mining region during the dry season. As miners packed up, the total hash rate, an indicator of the computing power in the network, halved from mid May to the end of the quarter. While Bitcoin’s hash rate has not recovered yet from the largest sustained percentage decline, perhaps the worst is already behind us in terms of the impact of China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining. We expect hash rate to recover over the course of the year, as miners find other venues of electricity and restart their operations. Many of the miners from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan are reportedly moving to various locations including Kazakhstan, Texas and Norway.\n\nJust as suddenly as the noise around environmental concerns rapidly died off towards the end of June -- so did concerns of China’s mining shutdown. Overall, these are net long-term positives for Bitcoin as what doesn’t kill it only makes it stronger. Indeed, as the world becomes more environmentally friendly and no institutional investors want to run afoul of the ESG movement, Bitcoin will need to pivot towards renewable energy to gain global adoption. Also, false narratives that Bitcoin is a “Chinese financial weapon” or that Bitcoin is a threat to US national security -- the code is literally open sourced -- can finally be put to bed as mining hashpower will more evenly be distributed throughout the world.\n\nTowards the end of the quarter, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in an effort to de-dollarize and reduce the cost of remittances. The government also announced a $30 airdrop for all adults through its own digital wallet. While Bitcoin’s global penetration is ~2%, El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce’s data indicates that 21-25% of the population would use BTC. While there was no meaningful impact on Bitcoin’s price, it was a global step towards wider adoption. Furthermore, it could be the first of several countries to adopt Bitcoin as Paraguay also announced a bill that would make Bitcoin legal tender.\n\nSource: Steve Hanke\n\nBitcoin Markets\n\nIn terms of markets, derivatives were punished this quarter. Markets started strong, with ETH touching $3,000 on May 3 only to have $246 million of open interest in the ETH call $5,000 strike the day after. However, by the end of the quarter, given the waterfall of liquidations, Bitcoin Futures open interest reset to levels seen at the start of the year.\n\nFrom the peak of April 14, open interest declined -56%. The first large liquidation happened April 18, with $9.3 billion of longs liquidated (mostly from Binance) but the market recovered after. Despite the April wipe out, on May 19, liquidiations reached $7.6 billion (mostly from Huobi, Bybit and OKEx), crashing the market further as leveraged hands were forced to sell.\n\nDespite the aggressive liquidations, and subsequent spot selling, large holders (100 to 1,000 BTC) actually accumulated during the selldown:\n\nSource: Woonomic, Glassnode\n\nIt also seemed as if traders in the US time zone were more bearish than those in Asia, a reversal of the 90-day period prior to mid-May.\n\nCurrency: 2Q Outperformers\n\nDogecoin (+325%), Ethereum Classic (+268%), <a href="https://messari.io/asset/xrp">XRP</a> (+12%) and Ethereum (+3%) had a positive quarter.\n\nDOGE benefited from its primary champion, Elon Musk, with no less than 13 tweets mentioning “Doge”. To his 57 million followers, Musk also tweeted that he’s “working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency” which baffled most crypto investors who noticed there had been no development for the past several years. However, the social media prowess of DOGE is strong and the price rallied to an ATH of <a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">$0.74 on May 8</a>, the time that SNL’s Dogefather aired. From the beginning of the month, DOGE’s price had multiplied by 12x at that time, before ending the quarter at ‘just’ 5x. Separately, Coinbase also listed DOGE on June 3 (in addition to an Ethereum-based dog coin SHIBA on June 15).\n\nHowever, even before the SNL run-up, DOGE rallied 500% over a week in mid-April, nearly flipping Binance Coin (BNB). Ahead of the Coinbase listing, Reddit’s wallstreetbets moderator reversed their ban on crypto -- allowing the discussion of BTC, ETH and DOGE. In less than 24 hours, they regretted the decision and reiterated its crypto ban on the subreddit. The DOGE pump that ensued was a demonstration of the power-of-the-people. While the price dropped -66% from its ATHs by quarter-end, DOGE’s outperformance over the quarter showed its meme sway remained strong.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) also saw a strong run up in the quarter. (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic/profile">ETC</a>) is the legacy chain that split from Ethereum following a contentious hard fork, known as The DAO fork, in Jul. 2017. On May 7ths, ETC saw a $55 billion 24h volume while its market cap was just $17 billion. Messari’s clean volume of vetted exchanges just showed <a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic/historical">$414 million</a> in volumes, indicating that there could have been a lot of fake volumes on ETC. Nevertheless, ETC had several status updates this quarter, publishing a roadmap and 2021 budget and introducing new software releases and network upgrades.\n\nXRP continued to outperform (+12%), following its Q1’21 +164% rally. This was on the back of easing concerns after a -30% selldown following the SEC\'s enforcement action in Dec-2020. Their General Counsel maintains that regulatory uncertainty is deliberately maintained by the SEC and that XRP is unjustly singled out as a security, while BTC and ETH roam free.\n\nLast but not least, ETH ended the quarter up +13%. Ethereum had a strong first half of the first quarter, with talks of a supercycle and flippening. Deribit, an options platform, saw $5,000 calls with a notional value of $331 million by May 11. Crypto loves a good narrative and Ethereum had many. Layer 2 scaling solutions were just kicking off, with Polygon taking the lead. Ethereum implemented the Berlin upgrade on April 15 and the upcoming EIP-1559 was also going to solve some of the pain of the high transaction fees. Furthermore, ETH’s supply was about to become deflationary in supply. ETH was also unscathed from ESG critics of Bitcoin mining as it was moving towards ETH 2.0 with a Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Furthermore, decentralized finance (DeFi) was reaching new highs for on-chain activity.\n\nHowever, in a Bitcoin selldown, gravity takes over and every token is correlated and this time was no different. ETH has still outperformed Bitcoin overall, after diverging around mid-April but gave back 16% of the performance in June.\n\nEthereum’s market share is still minor but climbing. Though DOGE, ETC and XRP’s market share in the currencies sector is still small. Bitcoin dominance in the Currencies sector fell from 79% to 65% this quarter:\n\nCurrency: 2Q Underperformers\n\nOther than <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> (-39%), <a href="https://messari.io/asset/dash">Dash</a> (-44%), <a href="https://messari.io/asset/stellar">Stellar</a> (-31%) and <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-sv">Bitcoin SV</a> (-30%) were key underperformers.\n\nDash was initially released as a fork of Bitcoin, but had a strong marketing narrative as it was focused on the payments use case. They released a couple of software and on-chain upgrades this quarter, that will cumulate to their July 15 hard fork. Their underperformance this quarter could be attributed to its strong run up of +109% in Feb-2021.\n\nStellar (XLM), a fork of the Ripple protocol, made two major network upgrades. While XRP and XLM were correlated last quarter, XLM underperformed this round. It could be a testament to the importance of the size of the community during a selldown.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) is a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork prioritizing what the creators consider strict adherence to Satoshi Nakamo\'s original Bitcoin client. It continued to underperform after just rallying +28% in 1Q’21. There have been no major announcements or upgrades from BSV this quarter. However, its primary founder has chosen to take further legal action in April on bitcoin.org to remove the Bitcoin whitepaper from its website. The website did not launch a defense, in order to protect its founder’s anonymity.\n\nBitcoin Dominance\n\nBitcoin’s overall cryptocurrency dominance dropped to 40% on May 18th, the day of the $7.6 billion liquidation, reaching levels unseen since July 2018. While Bitcoin’s price peaked on <a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin">April 14th at $64,654</a>, the altcoin total market cap peaked a month later on May 11th. This was similar to the pattern seen in Dec-2017 where BTC peaked a month before other currencies.\n\nCurrency Sector: Regulations\n\nApril\n\nStablecoin issuer Paxos gets a federal trust charter through the OCC, becoming the third federally regulated crypto bank.

If markets don’t recover from here, expectations are of a mild bear market since the rally was rather mild -- a 3.2x from the prior Bitcoin ATH instead of a 20x return. Furthermore, during the 2018 bear market, investors were still bullish and hopeful in the first half of 2018. However, this time around, sentiment instantly flipped bearish -- perhaps an indication that investors were hoping to front run any risk of a bear turn. Many investors have been traumatized by the 2017 and 2013 blow-off tops and subsequent deep and prolonged bear markets, so they could have been quick to pull the sell trigger. What we can conclude is that -- this rally, perhaps due to the wider institutional adoption of Bitcoin, is like no other in the past.\n\nBitcoin, and the crypto sector, had also never before seen an onslaught of attacks from all corners before. The neverending China ‘ban’ and ESG concerns reared its head at the same time, though these narratives have been long-standing sources of FUD for Bitcoin. However, the two largest headwinds for BTC in 2Q’21 were two of the largest tailwinds for ETH -- as Proof-of-Stake makes it harder to geographically locate and censor miners, and no institutional investor wants to seem irreverent to the ESG narrative. While these FUD narratives have been addressed and even falsified, Bitcoin and the crypto community will be stronger in continuing to take measures to evolve the ecosystem.\n\nLearn more from Mainnet 2021\n\nWatch main stage programming from Messari\'s annual summit Mainnet 2021 to learn more about this exciting topic.

        'Week In Review\n\nThe NEAR Foundation <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/796103c8-d77c-4408-a7d2-11c60048bfa7?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-near-ecosystem-treasury">submitted</a> a proposal on Jun. 16, 2021, to establish an Ecosystem Treasury DAO.\nThe Harmony team has <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/515adfc1-564a-4db6-8b2f-f89de0a80eb1?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-harmony-v418">updated</a> the release notes for v4.1.8 of its mainnet client.\nThe proposal to <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/8ba1e84e-ace3-475e-9e2e-a2108fd7898e?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-mirror-v2-passed">approve</a> Mirror V2 has passed.\nThe current Granada proposal has <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/d1efc43d-6c1b-4a82-90ba-7f7a06a008d2?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-granada-exploration">passed</a> the Exploration Phase, which ended on Jun. 23, 2021.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nLast week was a bloodbath in crypto markets. According to Messari’s <a href="https://messari.io/screener/all-assets-D86E0735">sector convention</a>, all sectors ended the week with double-digit losses. The least affected sector was Currencies which ended the week with a 12% loss aided by Bitcoin’s resilience to the continued market drop as a result of investors moving down the risk curve to less volatile assets.\n\nHigh beta sectors such as Decentralized Exchange and DeFi suffered the most during the week. The DeFi sector was hurt by the weekly performance of Uniswap (-20.9%), Aave (-30.16%), and MakerDAO (-24.15%). Similarly, the DEX sector was dragged down by Uniswap, PancakeSwap (-15.93%), THORChain (-30.52%), and SushiSwap (-17.99%).\n\nSector Portfolio Weights\n\nThe sector portfolio weights for this week’s report are as follows. The portfolio allocations are constructed following the market capitalization methodology using data as of June 24th.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 24th was brutal across cryptocurrency markets. China’s expanding crackdown on Bitcoin mining was the main catalyst for this week’s crash. On Monday, China summoned several major banks and payment companies to impose tougher actions over the trading of cryptocurrencies. Institutions were told not to provide products or services that include trading, clearing, or settlement of cryptocurrency transactions which ultimately led to a widespread bearish sentiment across the broader market. As a result, all sectors experienced heavy losses early on in the week with Bitcoin dipping below $30,000 for the first time in more than five months. The market shock was more drastic for risker tokens (primarily in the DeFi, DEX, and Web3 sectors). Losses across high beta tokens ranged from 20-30% over the past 7 days.\n\nSimilar to the sector performance, the Currency portfolio suffered the least losses during the week. The portfolio’s relatively high allocation to Bitcoin, which finished the week with only a 10% loss, was the reason for the outperformance of the Currency portfolio relative to other sector portfolios potentially signaling that appetite for risk is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe rotation from a risk-on to a risk-off environment can be better visualized by the recent bump in Bitcoin’s dominance. Since the market top in mid-May, Bitcoin’s dominance increased approximately 10% as investors pivot towards low volatility assets.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as last week, the DEX and DeFi portfolio suffered the most losses ending the week with a -23% return. In both cases, Uniswap was the main driver of performance given its high allocation in the portfolios.\n\nOver the past two weeks, volatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, reverted back to normal levels after experiencing a massive spike due to the market turbulence in May. However, portfolio volatility is starting to creep up once again as uncertainty about market conditions continues to mount.\n\nSimilar to last week, the DEX, DeFi, and Web3 portfolios experienced the highest increase in volatility during the week going from 5-6% to 10-11% in the span of three days. The Bitcoin-heavy portfolios (Top Assets and Currency portfolios) only saw a 2% bump over the same period of time.\n\nIn terms of correlation with Bitcoin, sector portfolios continue to see a decline week-over-week. As mentioned earlier, this behavior is due to Bitcoin’s outperformance relative to the broader market.\n\nSimilarly, the correlation with Ethereum is also seeing a slight decline this week but not as noticeable as with Bitcoin. Notably, the Currency portfolio (which has an allocation of 88% to Bitcoin) has seen the biggest decline as the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin trends lower.\n\n',

Following Messari’s sector convention, the Currency sector outperformed the rest ending the week with a 4.7% return. The sector benefited from Bitcoin’s 7-day performance (4.5% weekly return) which was one of the top-performing assets from the group of tokens covered in this report.\n\nDeFi and Web3 also ended the week with positive returns. On the positive side, Venus (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/venus">XVS</a>), 1inch (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/1inch">1INCH</a>), and BarnBridge (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/barnbridge">BOND</a>) pushed the DeFi sector up while Alchemix (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/alchemix">ALCX)</a>, Enzyme (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/enzyme-finance">MLN</a>), and Rari (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/rari-governance-token">RGT</a>) detracted from performance. The Web3 sector was propelled by Aragon (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/aragon-network">ANT</a>) which ended the week with a 134% return. However, the sector’s returns were offset by the negative performance of the remaining assets in the sector.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges and Smart Contract Platforms were the lagging sectors of the week. The DEX sector was primarily hurt by the weekly performance of SushiSwap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap">SUSHI</a>), Balancer (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/balancer">BAL</a>), and Curve (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/curve">CRV</a>). Similarly, the Smart Contract Platform sector was dragged down by the performance of Kusama (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/kusama">KSM</a>), Internet Computer (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/internet-computer">ICP</a>), and Celo (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/celo">CELO</a>).\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nFollowing the same approach as previous weeks, this week’s report focuses on comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. To achieve this, we constructed market-weighted “sector portfolios” by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of June 17th.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 17th was a bit chaotic. All sector portfolios started the week with disappointing performance with some reaching lows of -15% to -20% in the first few days of the week. However, performance across the board improved starting on June 14th gaining back some of the weekend’s losses. In the latter part of the week, asset prices tumbled once again sending three out of the five sector portfolios to negative territory.\n\nThe Currency sector portfolio was the clear winner of the week finishing up with a 3.1% weekly return. The performance was mainly driven by Bitcoin’s weekly performance which accounts for roughly 60% of the Currency portfolio. The runner-up was the Top Assets portfolio which also benefited from Bitcoin’s performance but was ultimately dragged down by Dogecoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">DOGE</a>) and Uniswap (UNI) which ended the week with -8% and -10% respectively.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolio suffered the most losses ending the week with a -9% return. In both cases, Uniswap was the main driver of performance given its relatively high allocation in the portfolios.\n\nVolatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, remains elevated across all sector portfolios relative to levels before the market crash in mid-May. However, given the market has been moving sideways without a clear direction since the crash, volatility has stabilized.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolios are currently the ones with the highest risk both running 30-day rolling volatility of 13%. The volatility of the Top Asset and Currency portfolios has been moving in the 6-8% range due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin which has been one of the least volatile assets relative to the rest of the tokens in this report.\n\nAll asset correlations continue to trend higher. The animation below highlights this trend over the past four weeks. As seen below, all correlations between sector portfolios are greater than 85% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%.\n\nInterestingly, the correlation between sector portfolios and Bitcoin is steadily decreasing. Aside from the portfolios that are heavily allocated to Bitcoin (Top Assets and Currency portfolios), all other sector portfolios have experienced some decline since reaching an all-time high last week.\n\nOn the contrary, the correlation with Ethereum is at an all-time high across the board. Aside from the Currency portfolio, all sector portfolios have a correlation with Ethereum higher than 95%.\n\nNormally both statistics move in the same direction; however, this is the first time this kind of dislocation takes place. The reason is that most assets have recently underperformed Bitcoin as investors move down the risk curve to lower volatility assets. As a result, Bitcoin’s market-cap dominance is on the rise increasing roughly 6% over the past 10 days.\n\n',

Following Messari’s sector convention, all five sectors covered in this report ended the week with positive weekly returns. The smart contract platform sector led the way posting a 7-day return of 3.11% propelled by the performance of assets such as Kusama (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/kusama">KSM</a>), Nervos Network (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/nervos-network">CKB</a>), Polkadot (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/polkadot">DOT</a>), Solana (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/solana">SOL</a>), and Cosmos (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/cosmos">ATOM</a>). The DeFi and DEX sectors followed closely, ending the week with a 2.7% return. Web3 finished with a 0.12% return making it the worst-performing sector of the group.\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nSimilar to last week, this week’s report focuses on comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. To achieve this, we constructed market-weighted “sector portfolios” by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of June 3rd.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 3rd was a bit bumpy. All sector portfolios had a small rally starting on May 27th which quickly reverted as the week continued. Asset prices across the board tumbled by mid-week resulting in losses of 10-25%. Starting on May 30th, portfolio returns found some footing as prices bounced back regaining some of the performance from earlier in the week.\n\nSector portfolios moved in tandem over the past 7-days following a nicely laid out V-shaped pattern. Although sector performance was relatively tight across all portfolios during most of the week, by the end of the week, the Web3 and DeFi portfolio began to lag the rest finishing the week with losses of -5.5% and -3.7% respectively. The losses of the Web3 portfolio were driven mostly by its relatively high allocation to Chainlink (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/chainlink">LINK</a>) which ended the week with a -6% return. Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/aave">AAVE</a>), which posted negative returns of -3.6% and -4.7%, drove most of the performance of the DeFi portfolio.\n\nVolatility, defined as the standard deviation of daily returns, remains elevated across all sector portfolios following the spike that was triggered by the market crash in mid-May. Before the crash, volatility across sectors was roughly the same, ranging from 3-6%. After the crash, sector volatility has become widely dispersed.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolios are currently the ones with the highest risk both running 30-day rolling volatility of 13%, a 2x increase compared to levels before the mid-May market crash. In contrast, the Top Asset and Currency portfolios have experienced the least increase in volatility moving roughly 3-4% higher compared to previous levels due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing the market crash, all asset correlations continue to move higher. The animation below highlights this trend over the past four weeks. The correlation matrices shown below are computed on a weekly basis using a 30-day lookback to capture the evolution of the correlation structure between sectors.\n\nAs seen below, correlations between sectors are well above 85% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%. In markets like this where all assets move in unison, investors can get direct directional exposure by simply owning any crypto asset, the only difference is the amount of risk they are willing to take on.\n\nThe correlation between the sector portfolios and Bitcoin continues to steadily increase. The upward trend started in the beginning of May as the markets entered turbulent waters. As of June 3rd, all sector portfolios have a correlation to Bitcoin higher than 80%.\n\nThe increase is most noticeable for the DeFi and DEX portfolios which saw a jump of more than 45% in the past 30 days. The Web3 and Smart Contract Platforms portfolios followed a similar pattern increasing roughly 20% over the same period.\n\nThe correlation between Ethereum and all sector portfolios is now equal to or above 90%. Aside from the portfolios that have a hefty allocation to Ethereum (Smart Contract Platforms and Top Assets), the DeFi and DEX portfolios are the ones with the highest correlation coefficients standing at 94% and 93% respectively.\n\n',

While most assets remain well below their ATH, the market found some footing on Monday 24th possibly marking the end of the market decline. Following Messari’s sector convention, three out of the five sectors covered in this report had negative 7-day returns but nothing as extreme compared to last week’s performance. On the positive side, Web3 and DEXs were the two sectors with positive performance for the week. On the contrary, Currencies and DeFi were the underperforming sectors of the week with a negative return of -3.5% and -3.9%.\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nThis week’s report revolves around comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. In order to achieve this, we selected the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each of the sectors covered in this report and constructed a market-weighted portfolio that acts as a proxy for the overall sector. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of May 27th.\n\nThe following analytics are derived using this set of portfolios in order to get an estimated comparison of their relative performance with each other.\n\nSector Portfolio Deep Dive\n\nPerformance across the market continued to deteriorate well into the March 20th to March 27th week. Starting March 20th, all sectors rebounded experiencing a sudden bounce in prices with some reaching a 15-25% performance in one single day. However, the pump was short-lived across all sectors as the market continued to decline in the coming days. Starting on Monday 24th, the market found some relief as asset prices began to turn around signaling the potential end to the sudden market crashed triggered last week.\n\nSector portfolios moved in tandem over the past 7-days following a nicely laid out V-shaped pattern. Cumulative performance starting on May 20th across sectors sunk as much as 30% by mid-week but quickly bounced back capturing back some of the early gains of the week. Although sector performance was relatively tight across all portfolios during most of the week, by the end of the week Web3 and DEXs began to outpace the rest of the groups. Both portfolios finished the week with a 28% return followed by the smart contract platform portfolio which ended the week with a 23% return. The currencies portfolio underperforming the rest posting a weekly return of 8%.\n\nFrom a volatility perspective, defined as the standard deviation of daily returns, all sector portfolios saw a similar spike starting in mid-May as the market began its drastic decline. Before the crash, volatility across sectors ranged from 3-6%. After the crash, sector volatility is ranging from a low of 6% to a high of 12%. The DEX portfolio, composed primarily of Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and THORChain, experience the highest increase in volatility moving from 6% to an all-time high of 12.5% over the past two weeks. The top asset and currency portfolios are the least volatile primarily due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs of consequence of the market crash, all asset correlations reached new all-time highs. The animation below highlights this tendency towards higher correlation over the past four weeks. The correlation matrices shown below are computed on a weekly basis using a 30-day lookback to accurately depict the evolution of the correlation structure between the sector portfolios. As seen below, correlations between sectors are well above 80% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%. One caveat worth highlight is that some sector portfolios share the same underlying assets which directly results in higher correlation coefficients between some pairs.\n\nThe correlation between the sector portfolios and Bitcoin has been increasing since the beginning of May. The trend accelerated in mid-May as the market went belly up. The acceleration is most noticeable in the DeFi and DEX portfolios which saw a jump of roughly 20% in the past two weeks and approximately 40% since the beginning of the month. The Web3 and smart contract platform portfolio have seen a more gradual increase in their correlation coefficients going from 70% at the beginning of May to 85-87% by the end of the month. Unsurprisingly, the top assets and currency portfolios have a correlation greater than 95% as a result of Bitcoin’s dominance in the portfolios. As of May 27th, the correlation coefficient across all sector portfolios is greater than 80%.\n\nThe correlation between Ethereum and all sector portfolios is also well above 80%. Aside from the portfolios that have a hefty allocation to Ethreuem (smart contract platforms and top assets), the DeFi and DEX portfolios are the ones with the highest correlation coefficients standing at 91% and 89% as of yesterday. This is roughly 10% higher when compared to the correlation of both portfolios with Bitcoin potentially signaling that DeFi assets are beginning to decouple from Bitcoin. As of yesterday, the correlation coefficient of all sector portfolios is greater than 85%.\n\n',

        'Week In Review\n\nNotable Messari Enterprise Updates\n\nZilliqa team <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/48de0869-31a3-48d5-98aa-953fae015e69">released</a> v8.0.3 of its mainnet client.\nVoting on a proposal to <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/d4f0b82b-0bd8-49e2-bc91-43846c06239d">add</a> Kyber DMM to KyberDAO\nCGP-28 <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/de804a63-1da6-42a9-abc4-7c55e5fb8546">passed</a> its referendum period which ended on May 13, 2021, and its proposed code changes were executed on May 18, 2021.\nSushiswap team <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/b2f2fadc-22cc-4839-8ca5-a04bd3ae3330">announced</a> that the native token launchpad, called MISO (Minimal Initial SushiSwap Offering) will be launched on May 20, 2021.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nThe week ending May 20th saw one of the biggest drawdowns in recent months. The market as a whole tumbled more than 40% from its peak with riskier tokens suffering even higher losses. Volatility reared its ugly head reminding everyone that crypto markets are not for the faint of heart. As performance during the week deteriorated, market volatility increased across the board. Additionally, asset correlations saw a massive spike across all sectors covered in this report driven by the market correction.\n\nOver the week the currency sector suffered the least compared to other sectors. The sector – composed of Bitcoin, Doge, etc – ended the week with a -16% loss closely followed by DeFi which posted a negative return of -19%. Decentralized exchanges and Web3 suffered most severely with total weekly losses of -22% and -26% respectively.\n\nThere was no single catalyst that can explain the past week’s movements. The selldown began on the back of Elon’s tweets that Tesla was no longer accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment due to environmental concerns. Macroeconomic concerns also contributed, mainly from the higher than expected inflation print of 4.2% year-on-year sparking fears of tapering. Early in the week, newsflow of Binance facing regulatory scrutiny and reiterations from 2017 that China doesn’t accept crypto as a form of payment also exacerbated the issue.\n\nThe main culprit has been increased leverage. Binance, the world’s largest exchange, has seen positive funding rates for the past months:\n\n<a href="https://messari.io/asset/ethereum">ETH</a> investors also saw climbing open interest, indicating that demand was not based on spot buying in recent weeks.\n\nTowards the end of the week, funding rates were erratic, with some exchanges printing positive rates and others printing negative rates (see chart below). This showed that markets were still disorderly. Predicted funding rates also kept spiking at each dip, as long traders bought the dip. However, as prices moved down, traders increasingly bought until they triggered the next liquidation cascade, causing prices to dive further. An example is FTX (where there is more intra-day granular data) -- rates were still climbing on the week until it capitulated on May 20.\n\nThe activity was exacerbated on Wednesday as many centralized exchanges were congested, delaying clients from trading. The Ethereum network also saw heavy use, anecdotally printing $1,600 in gas fees for transactions, even to avoid liquidation. As a result of the trading friction, prices were slow to find footing.\n\nSector Drill Down - Risk and Performance Review\n\nTop Assets\n\nIn the early days of the week, performance in the top ten assets (by market cap) fluctuated around zero with some assets performing well while others lagged. By mid-week, performance took a nasty turn, shifting a positive week into a bloodbath. By the end of the week, all top assets finished the session with double-digit losses. Cardano (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/cardano">ADA</a>) and Dogecoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">DOGE</a>) were the least affected in the group ending the week with returns of -13% and -26%. Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/chainlink">LINK</a>), Uniswap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/uniswap">UNI</a>), Litecoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/litecoin">LTC</a>), and Binance coin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/binance-coin">BNB</a>) suffered the most, losing over 40% over the week.\n\nUnsurprisingly, volatility across the top ten experienced a sudden spike. On a 30-day rolling basis, volatility increased roughly 5% for most assets over the week. In previous weeks, volatility ranged between 5% and 9% however, volatility across the group is now above 10%. Bitcoin is the only exception with rolling volatility of 6%.\n\nAs the market came crashing down, correlations in the group went through the roof. As of yesterday, 30-day correlations among top assets are well above 50%.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin also increased dramatically over the week. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) correlation increased over 60% during the week while Uniswap (UNI) saw a jump of roughly 30%. All assets now have a correlation greater than 60% with some reaching highs of 80%.\n\nDeFi\n\nFollowing the same pace as the rest of the market, DeFi assets dumped heavily during the week. For the majority of the week, assets moved sideways without tilting towards any specific direction. On Tuesday, SushiSwap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap">SUSHI</a>), Synthetic (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/synthetix">SNX</a>), and Aave (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/aave">AAVE</a>) had a nice rally which turned out to be short-lived. Similar to the top ten, DeFi assets ended the week with two-digit losses ranging from -23% to -51%. Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap">CAKE</a>) experienced the largest losses ending the week with negative returns of -45% and -52%. Arguably, they were also most held tokens as leaders in the decentralized exchange (DEX) segment.\n\nNotably, total value locked (TVL) in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum ecosystems were impacted. From the peak, BSC and ETH lost -62% and -27% of TVL in USD terms. This indicates that tokens in Ethereum DeFi largely were not withdrawn from protocols. BSC saw an exploit on BUNNY, perhaps worsening the performance of their overall TVL.\n\nVolatility within DeFi increased past its 3-month high reaching levels above 10% across all assets. Notably, ThorChain’s (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/thorchain">RUNE</a>) Rune’s volatility doubled going from 7% to 14% in the span of three days. Within the group, SushiSwap (SUSHI) is the riskiest asset with rolling volatility of 16%. As of May 20th, volatility is ranging between 10% and 16%.\n\nCorrelation in the sector also reached new all-time highs. On average, the correlation between DeFi assets ranged from 10% to 50% in previous weeks. After the market drop, correlation in the group skyrocketed now ranging from 50% to as high as 89%.\n\nSimilarly, the correlation between DeFi assets and Ethereum is close to its all-time high. Previously, the sector’s correlation was relatively high but a bit dispersed. Now, correlations are concentrated on the high end of the spectrum ranging from 70% to 80%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nAlthough currencies performed the best amidst the bloodbath, the sector still experienced a turbulent week. All of the currencies covered in the report saw losses of more than 20% during the week. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/xrp">XRP</a>) withheld downward pressure better than most of the sector finishing the week with a -26% return. On the other hand, Monero (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/monero">XMR</a>) and Dash (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/dash">DASH</a>) ended the week with losses of more than 50%, totally wiping their gains from previous weeks.\n\nVolatility in the sector increased to levels higher than 10% for most currencies. Interestingly, on a rolling basis, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) volatility decreased considerably since its wild price movement in late April and early May. DOGE’s volatility remains one of the highest in the group right behind Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-cash">BCH</a>) which has been consistently increasing since May reaching a new high of 17%. The rest of the volatilities range from 6% to 14% with Bitcoin being the least volatile asset in the sector.\n\nCorrelations between currencies were already relatively high over the past few months. The one notable change over the week is Dogecoin (DOGE). The token’s correlation with the rest of the group increased approximately 50% week-on-week.\n\nLikewise, the correlation between currencies and Bitcoin has been trending up since mid April. Correlations in the group are now concentrated between 80% and 86%. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) correlation increased from 6% to 62% in the past two weeks.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nSmart contract platforms suffered the same faith as all the assets in this report. The week seemed to be good for Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/polkadot">DOT</a>) which by mid-week were clearly outperforming the rest of the group. By the end of the week, all assets tumbled down in unison. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/solana">SOL</a>) had the smallest losses in the sector ending the week with negative returns of -13.7% and -23.3% respectively. <a href="https://messari.io/asset/eos">EOS</a> and Binance Coin (BNB) ended the week at the bottom of the pack with returns of -48.9% and -49.7% respectively.\n\nVolatility in the sector increased roughly 4% to 5% across most assets. Solana’s (SOL) volatility saw the biggest jump in the sector going from 5% to 13% over the week. EOS’s volatility reached a new all-time high of 21% making it the riskiest asset in the smart contract platform sector.\n\nIn previous weeks, correlations in the sector were relatively low when compared to the rest of the sectors in the report. Solana (SOL) was consistently uncorrelated with the rest of the assets in the group. However, as the whole market crashed down correlations inevitably increased. In Solana’s case, correlation increased roughly 60% with the rest of the assets week-over-week. Correlations in the sector are now ranging from 40% to as high as 96%.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin had been constantly increasing since mid April. After this week, the trend accelerated pushing correlations close to all-time highs reaching levels above 75% for the majority of the assets in the sector. Solana’s (SOL) correlation went from negative to positive during the week experiencing a jump of approximately 60%.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nDecentralized exchanges were one of the worst-performing sectors of the week. The sector was down 21% in the past seven days. Similar to the rest, DEX’s performance went south starting Wednesday, tumbling down to double-digit losses. SushiSwap (SUSHI) had the least amount of losses of the group ending with a -23% loss. The rest of the DEXs suffered losses greater than 30% with PancakSwap (CAKE) and Curve (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/curve">CRV</a>) losing more than -50% over the week.\n\nVolatility in the sector moved from a 4-9% range to an 8-15% range. On the lower end are Bancor (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bancor">BNT</a>) and Uniswap (UNI) with rolling volatility of 8.8% and 9.3%. On the high end is SushiSwap (SUSHI) with a volatility of 16%.\n\nApart from an overall increase in correlations driven by the market correction, the only notable change week-over-week happened with Uniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and ThorChain (RUNE). All three assets had been on the low positive end of the correlation spectrum but after last week’s market moves, their correlation with the rest of the group reached a new all-time high. As of yesterday, correlations in the sector are all greater than 60%.\n\nDEX’s correlation with Bitcoin didn’t see a massive jump over the week. Uniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and ThorChain (RUNE) are the exceptions seeing an increase in their correlations with Bitcoin of approximately 30%.\n\nWeb3\n\nDuring the week, Web3 was the worst-performing sector across all sectors covered in this report. The group ended the week with an average loss of -25.7%. Compared to other sectors, Web3 assets moved very close to each other throughout the week. All assets began to experience losses Sunday, May 16 with only Helium (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/helium">HNT</a>) recovering slightly in the following days. The whole sector went south with the rest of the market on Wednesday suffering heavy losses ranging from -27% to 51%. HNT came out on top of the group, losing -27% during the week. Siacoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/siacoin">SIA</a>) and Stacks (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/stacks">STX</a>) were underperformers standing at -49% and -51%.\n\nWeb3 assets saw similar jumps in volatility as the rest of the sectors. On average, volatility increased roughly 4% across the group. Volatility in the sector now ranged from a low of 9% to a high of 12%.\n\nCorrelations in the group increased as a consequence of the market crash. Notably, Livepeer (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/livepeer">LPT</a>) and Arweave (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/arweave">AR</a>) went from having negative-to-muted correlations to positive correlations over the week.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as the rest of the sectors, Web3 assets experienced an uptick in correlation to Bitcoin. While most are in the 70% to 85%, Livepeer (LPT) and Arweave (AR) have lower correlations both hovering at 44%.\n\n',

Despite the bloodbath, smart contract platforms showed incredible resilience to the market turbulence being the only sector that ended the week with a positive return of 4.6%. On the negative side, Currencies and Web3 lagged the rest of the sectors finishing the week with double-digit losses of -12% and -15% respective\n\nSector Drill Down - Risk and Performance Review\n\nTop Assets\n\nAfter a phenomenal week, the top assets had a bit of a bumpy ride this week. All assets started the week with negative returns setting the tone for the following days. All assets in the top ten tumbled sharply Wednesday night following the rest of the market. By the end of the week, only Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/cardano">ADA</a>) ended the week with positive returns of 10% and 6%. The rest of the assets in the top ten ended in negative territory. Notably, Dogecoin (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">DOGE</a>), last week’s outperformer, suffered a loss of 40% whipping out about half of last week’s performance.\n\nDespite the turbulent week, volatilities in the top ten remain relatively stable. As of yesterday, asset volatility remained below 10% with the exception of Dogecoin (DOGE) which continues to be elevated at 24%.\n\nAs a result of the recent sell-off, correlations among the top ten assets increased over the week. In particular, Dogecoin (DOGE) is slowly becoming more correlated with the rest of the group.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin saw an uptick during the week across most top assets. Notably, the correlation between Bitcoin and Uniswap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/uniswap">UNI</a>) increased approximately 20% from 14% to 34% over the week.\n\nDeFi\n\nDeFi assets also had a crazy week. Most started the week with negative returns then hovered around the zero line for the remaining of the week. Early in the week, SushiSwap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap">SUSHI</a>) was the decisive winner reaching a return as high as 22% in two days. Yearn (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/yearn-finance">YFI</a>) was by far the most interesting token in the DeFi space in terms of performance. The token saw a huge upswing starting on Tuesday reaching a return as high as 63% by Thursday, May 12th which was followed by a 40% drop the next day. Despite the drop, Yearn (YFI) was the clear outperformer of the week ending with a strong 27% return. Aave ended the week in second place with a total weekly return of 14%. On the negative side, Terra (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/terra">LUNA</a>) and PancakeSwap (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap">CAKE</a>) lagged the rest of the group ending the week with a return of -12% and -22% respectively.\n\nVolatility in the DeFi sector remains in the 5% to 10% range for most assets. Week-over-week, Yearn (YFI) is the only asset with a noticeable change in volatility given its recent moves. The token’s volatility increased 6% to 9.8% making it the second most volatile asset in the group. Across the top DeFi asset, MakerDAO (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/maker">MKR</a>) continues to be the riskiest asset with rolling volatility of 10.6%.\n\nCorrelations didn\'t change drastically over the week. In previous weeks, Terra (LUNA) was one of the most uncorrelated assets within the group. However, recently LUNA has become more correlated with most DeFi assets with the exception of <a href="https://messari.io/asset/thorchain">Rune</a>. Correlation between Rune and LUNA is declining week-over-week reaching an all-time low of -17%.\n\nCorrelation with Ethereum across DeFi assets has been a bit mixed during the week. On the positive side, Uniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and MakerDAO (MKR) saw their correlation with Ethereum spike over the week. On the contrary, Aave (AAVE) and Yearn (YFI) experience a slight decline week-on-week. As of May 13th, correlation in the group range from a low of 27% to a high of 64%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe currency sector had a rough week. Despite some assets starting the week with strong performance, Wednesday’s sell-off pushed the whole sector to negative territory. The assets that were least affected by the market drop were Monero (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/monero">XMR</a>) and Dash (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/dash">DASH</a>) which ended the week with negative returns of 4% and 7% respectively. The most affected were Ripple (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/xrp">XRP</a>), Bitcoin SV (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin-sv">BSV</a>), and Dogecoin (DOGE) suffering losses of -27%, -28%, and -40%.\n\nVolatility in the sector increased slightly over the week. Most assets saw a small jump of 1-2% as a consequence of the turbulent week.\n\nCorrelations in the group remain skewed towards the upper end of the spectrum. Currencies is the most correlated sector compared to the rest covered in this report with most asset correlations being above 40%.\n\nFollowing a similar pattern, correlation with Bitcoin continues to rise week-over-week. Now, the correlation with Bitcoin is greater than 60% across the sector. Dogecoin (DOGE) is the exception standing at 14% but has recently been steadily increasing over the past few weeks.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nSimilar to the rest of the sectors, smart contracts platforms also experience a high volatility week. Most hovered around the zero line during the first part of the week while others had strong upswings. Similar to Yearn, <a href="https://messari.io/asset/eos">EOS’</a>s price skyrocketed reaching a return of 60% by the middle of the week but quickly gave back some of the performance as the week came to a close. Despite the bump in volatility, EOS remained the leader in the group finishing the week with a 16%. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) followed closely with total weekly returns of 10% and 7%. The rest of the assets in the sector ended the week in the red with Neo (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/neo">NEO</a>) and VeChain (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/vechain">VET</a>) being the underperformers of the group.\n\nMost smart contract platforms are seeing an upward trend in their volatility. Most notable is EOS’s volatility which increased drastically over the week as a result of its sudden price action. The token’s volatility increased from 9% to 16% in the span of three days. Neo (NEO), EOS, and Cardano (ADA) also experienced an increase in volatility in the 1-3% range.\n\nWeek-over-week correlation among smart contract platforms slightly decreased. Solana (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/solana">SOL</a>) remains the only negatively correlated asset in the sector.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin continues to rise week-on-week. Now, correlations with Bitcoin are above 50% with Solana (SOL) being the only exception standing at -10%. However, the token has seen a drastic change in recent weeks making it increasingly more correlated with Bitcoin.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nThe decentralized exchanges sector followed a similar pattern as the rest of the sectors during the week. The first few days were a little mixed between good and bad; some DEXs had strong positive performance while others lagged. However, the whole sector declined in unison at the beginning of the week sending all assets to negative territory. In the following days, most assets rebounded sharply with Loopring (LRC) leading the pack reaching a return of approximately 50% by Wednesday. As is the case with the rest of the sectors, DEX’s experienced heavy losses in the middle of the week pushing most to end the week with negative returns. Curve (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/curve">CRV</a>) was the outperforming of the group ending the week with a 17% return while PancakeSwap (CAKE) suffered the most finishing with a -23% return.\n\nVolatility across most decentralized exchanges was stable during the week. Exceptions include Uniswap (UNI) and Loopring (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/loopring">LRC</a>). Over the week Uniswap’s volatility decreased 2% while Loopring’s increased by the same percentage. As of yesterday, volatility in the sector ranges from 5% to 10%.\n\nCorrelation between DEXs continues on the same pattern as previous weeks. Uniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Rune are the most uncorrelated assets in the sectors. However, over the week their correlation with the rest of the assets slightly increased.\n\nCorrelations with Bitcoin are starting to trend up. Correlations in the sector are above 40% for most DEXs. Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE) saw jumps of 20% and 30% over the week.\n\nWeb3\n\nWeb3 was the worst-performing sector of the week ending with a -14.7% loss. Despite the bloodbath in the sector, Livepeer (LPT) and Arweave (AR) managed to end the week in the positive with total weekly returns of 16% and 6%. The rest of the assets in the sector suffered significant losses ranging from -10% to -27%.\n\nDespite the crazy week, volatility remained relatively stable. Livepeer (LPT) is the only exception which saw a 3% increase in volatility over the week.\n\nCorrelation among the assets in the sector increased over the week driven by the market decline. Week-on-week, Arweave (AR) has become increasingly correlated with the sector while Livepeer (LPT) is becoming less correlated with the rest of the assets in the group.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin across most Web3 assets has been consistently increasing over the past weeks. Most assets have a correlation greater than 50%. Livepeer’s (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/livepeer">LPT</a>) correlation declined dramatically during the week tumbling from 50% to 29%. Arweave (<a href="https://messari.io/asset/arweave">AR</a>) correlation is at 28% making it the only other Web3 asset with a correlation of less than 50% in the group.\n\n',

        'Week In Review\n\nNotable Messari Updates\n\nKadena Kadena <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/877a284a-9bd7-4fc6-9836-fccdcd9f2ebe">released</a> Chainweb Mainnet 2.7 (Kadena\'s mainnet client) on Apr. 29, 2021.\nThe Taproot signaling period has <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/11212169-6e13-4968-9598-2658b5fadf26">started</a>.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nThe week ending May 6th was led by the smart contract sector dominating the week with a 30% return. The sector as a whole was boosted by Ethereum which smashed through its all-time high, rising to over $3,600. Web-3 came in second place closely followed by Currencies. On the low end, DeFi and decentralized exchanges ended the week in positive territory but lagged the rest of the sectors.\n\nRisk and Performance Review\n\nTop Assets\n\nThe week ending on May 6th was dictated once again by Dogecoin (DOGE). The surge in retail euphoria fueled DOGE’s returns making it the best-performing assets of the week with a total weekly return of 104%. Aside from DOGE’s insane performance, the rest of the assets in the top ten also had great weekly returns. The majority of the top ten ended the week deep in the green zone with double-digit returns. The only exceptions were Bitcoin (BTC) and Uniswap (UNI) which ended with a return of 4% and -2% for the week.\n\nTop asset volatilities remained stable over the week. The majority continues to be below the 7% mark with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) being the only two exceptions. In XRP’s case, volatility decreased from 14% to 12% week-over-week while DOGE’s continues to increase reaching a new high of 24% making it the riskiest asset in the group.\n\nThe 30-day correlation between most of the top assets didn’t change much over the week. The only notable change was Uniswap (UNI) which saw a slight decrease in correlation with the rest of the assets in the group.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin is starting to increase across the group. As of the end of the week, eight out of the top ten have a correlation with Bitcoin greater than 40%. Dogecoin (DOGE) has remained stable, hovering around the zero line while Uniswap’s correlation continues to decrease dipping below the 20% mark.\n\nDeFi\n\nLast week was a bit mixed for DeFi assets. While most decentralized exchanges had muted-to-negative returns, THORChain’s RUNE came out on top of the DeFi sector with a total weekly return of 28%. Lending protocols such as MakerDAO (MKR) and Compound (COMP) closely followed with weekly returns of 25% and 22% respectively. Decentralized exchanges including PanckaSwap (CAKE), SushiSwap (SUSHI), and Uniswap (UNI) came in last with weekly returns of 0.6%, -1.5%, and -2.3%\n\nVolatilities across DeFi assets are beginning to pick up. Overall the sector has seen a steady increase in volatility starting in mid-April. Most remain below 10% with the exception of MakerDAO (MKR) and RUNE which have rolling volatility slightly above the 10% level.\n\nCorrelations between DeFi assets have not changed drastically over the week. Week-over-week, Terra (LUNA) has seen a slight increase in correlation with the rest of the group. In contrast, Uniswap (UNI) is starting to become slightly more uncorrelated with the rest of the sector.\n\nIn terms of correlation with Bitcoin, all DeFi assets saw a small bounce over the week. The correlation between Uniswap (UNI) and Bitcoin (BTC) continues to decrease, reaching a level below 20%. MakerDAO (MKR) is the only other asset in the group with a correlation to Bitcoin below the 20% mark.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe currency sector as a whole had a phenomenal week. As mentioned previously, the clear outperformer, and outlier, of the group was Dogecoin (DOGE) with a massive weekly return of 104%. Bitcoin’s forks, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bitcoin SV (BSV) were the second and third best-performing assets in the group with returns of 51% and 47% over the week. Dash (DASH), Litcoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), and Ripple (XRP) also had double-digit weeks with performances ranging between 28% and 38%. Bitcoin (BTC) and Monero (XMR) were the laggards of the group ending the week with returns of 4% and -0.5%.\n\nVolatility in the currency sector is starting to pick up. While most remain under 10%, Bitcoin’s forks saw a sudden spike in volatility over the week pushing them above 10%. Notably, Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) volatility increased from 8% to 12% in one single day.\n\nCorrelations across currencies remain on the high end of the correlation spectrum. The trend continues as correlations continue to climb across the group week-on-week. As of yesterday, the currency sector is the most correlated across all sectors covered in this report.\n\nUnsurprisingly, all currencies are starting to see an increase in their correlation to Bitcoin. Most are now above the 60% correlation level. Notably, Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) are at an all-time high reaching correlations to Bitcoin of 82% and 87% respectively.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nThe smart contract platform sector was by far the best performing sector during the week. Overall, the group was up 30% boosted by the excitement around Ethereum’s all-time high week. EOS led the smart contract sector completely outpacing the rest with a whopping 52% weekly return. NEO and Ethereum (ETH) followed closely ending the week with returns of 29% and 27% respectively. Polkadot (DOT), Tron (TRX), Cosmos (ATOM), Binance Coin (BNB), and Cardano (ADA) also had strong weekly performance ranging from a low of 11% to a high of 20%. Interestingly, Solana (SOL) was the only smart contract platform that ended the week in negative territory despite being the top-performing asset last week.\n\nAs is the case with most assets in this report, volatilities across smart contracts platforms are starting to increase. EOS saw the biggest increase over the week going from 7% to 11% in the span of two days. On the contrary, Tron (TRX) is the only asset with decreasing volatility across the assets in the sector.\n\nCorrelation in the sector did not change much over the week. Solana (SOL) saw a slight increase in correlation during the week but it’s still the only token that remains negatively correlated to the rest of the assets in the group.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin across smart contract platforms has been on the rise since the beginning of May. NEO, Tron (TRX), and Solana (SOL) are the three notable tokens seeing a rapid increase in correlation. Solana (SOL) continues to be the only asset with a negative correlation to Bitcoin making it a potential diversifier in the event of a sudden Bitcoin drop.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nThe decentralized exchange sector was the worst-performing sector of the week ending with a 5% return. The group had one of the widest distributions of total returns with some DEXs having a great week while others fell flat. This week, RUNE led the group with a total return of 28%. Other DEXs with two-digit weekly returns include Bancor (BNT), 0x, and 1inch with performance ranging from 10% to 15%. Uniswap (UNI) was the underperformer of the group ending the week with a -2.3% return despite the highly anticipated launch of Uniswap V3.\n\nUnlike most other sectors, volatilities across decentralized exchanges have remained relatively stable in the past weeks. Since April, Bancor’s (BNT) volatility has been hovering around 5% making it the least risky asset in the sector. On the contrary, RUNE’s volatility has steadily increased over the past month reaching an all-time high of 10% as of May 6th.\n\nIn terms of correlations, Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE) are the notable tokens of the week. Both are becoming slightly less correlated with the rest of the assets in the sector. Interestingly, the remaining assets experienced the opposite seeing a slight increase in correlation with one another.\n\nCorrelation between decentralized exchanges and Bitcoin has followed a similar trend over the past months. During last week, most DEXs experienced a slight bump in their correlation to Bitcoin pushing some over the 70% level. Across the sector, Uniswap (UNI) is the only asset that is consistently seeing a decrease in correlation with Bitcoin.\n\nWeb3\n\nThe Web3 sector was the second-best performing sector of the week with an overall return of 16%. Leading oracle provider, Chainlink dominated the Web3 sector ending the week with a 34% return. Performance among the remaining assets hovered around zero. On the positive side, Helium (HNT), Siacoin (SC), and The Graph (GRT) finished the week with low one-digit positive returns. Storj (STORJ) Stacks (STX), and Arweave (AR) were the underperformers of the group ending the week in negative territory.\n\nVolatility across the Web3 sector has become more stable over the past week. Livepeer (LPT), Storj (STORJ), and Stacks (STX) had volatilities above 20% in the past month but have seen notable reductions of more than 15% in the last three weeks. As of yesterday, volatilities in the sector have stabilized ranging from 6% to 11%.\n\nCorrelations in the sector are not concentrated on either side of the spectrum. Over the past 30-days, Web3 has been the most uncorrelated sector compared to the rest covered in this report. One token worth highlighting is Stacks (STX) which has become significantly more correlated with Helium (HNT) and Livepeer (LPT) week-over-week.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin remains highly dispersed in the Web3 sector. However, this past week most assets experience a significant jump pushing all correlations past 30%. Notably, Helium (HNT), Arweave (AR), and Stacks (STX) saw increases of more than 20% over the week.\n\n',

        'Week In Review\n\nNotable Messari Updates\n\nThe Celo (CELO) <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/33e91d00-774f-4a3f-accd-52815546de8e?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=top&utm_campaign=price-perf-ap-22">proposal</a> to activate cEUR has passed, and cEUR transfers are now enabled.\nThe Prysmatic Labs team has <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/1ecbecc6-59c8-4665-997e-84daa94148b8">released</a> a hotfix with two critical fixes. They later shared an <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/1ecbecc6-59c8-4665-997e-84daa94148b8">incident report </a>summarizing the issues that temporarily prevented Prysm Beacon Nodes from proposing new blocks.\nOasis Network validators accepted and executed the Cobalt <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/297baad3-19f8-4355-a3c7-63de18b84a02">upgrade</a>, unlocking light client support, and cross-ParaTime token transfers.\nThe Stellar Development Foundation is <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/065d92c0-4ad3-40c4-9001-83eadfe6cf38">asking</a> all those who run a Stellar node of any kind to upgrade to Protocol 17 as soon as possible.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nThe week ending April 29th was led by the decentralized exchange sector. Despite the drawdown during the weekend, DEXs rebounded strongly to end the weekend with a 29% return. The broad DeFi sector came in second place posting a weekly return of 24%. Web-3 and currency ended the week in positive territory but lagged the rest of the sectors.\n\nRisk and Performance Review\n\nTop Assets\n\nAs is the case with the majority of the charts in this report, all top assets by market capitalization experienced a sharp decline during the weekend. However, most assets quickly rebounded, ending the week in positive territory. Among the top assets Uniswap (UNI), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) ended the week with double-digit returns of 24%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) had muted weekly returns while Polkadot (DOT), Litecoin (LTC), and Chainlink (LINK) finished the week with slightly negative returns.\n\nVolatility (measured as the rolling standard deviation of daily returns) across most top assets has been on the decline since the beginning of March 2021. Binance Coin (BNB) had the highest decline towards the end of March with volatility dropping approximately 10%. Starting in April, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) saw a spike in volatility reaching levels of 23% and 14% as of April 29th. DOGE is correlated to social media activity while XRP has been correlated to positive newsflow on the SEC lawsuit and rumors that they might even be re-listed on major exchanges.\n\nCorrelation among the majority of the top assets remains high. The exception is Dogecoin (DOGE) which is the only asset with negative correlations to the rest of the group. This was caused by its rapid run-up in recent weeks and social media as its primary catalyst. DOGE benefited from Elon Musk’s tweet that the Saturday Night Live episode on May 8 would be called the Dogefather\n\nCorrelations with Bitcoin have been widely dispersed over the past few months. Around mid-February, Uniswap (UNI), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) were negatively correlated to Bitcoin for a short period of time. UNI was the first to be negatively correlated as the price rallied on the back of strong growth in trading volumes. ADA followed in a strong price rally due to its strong community. Correlations across all assets have picked up since the beginning of March with the exception of Dogecoin (DOGE) which saw an abrupt decrease in the middle of April as a consequence of its skyrocketing performance due to another Elon Musk tweet.\n\nDeFi\n\nDeFi was the second-best performing sector of the week showing some resilience to the weekend’s market shock. As of April 29th, the sector ended the week with a total return of 24%. All DeFi assets finished the week in the green with MakerDAO (MKR) being the only exception, coming in at the bottom of the group with a muted return of -0.8%. This was due to its strong price rally of up to a peak of +130% in the month of April. MKR has had a busy month with several proposed parameter changes including completing their debt ceiling increase. Several additions to add tokens for inclusion as an approved collateral type is also under the proposal.\n\nThis week’s outperformers were led by PancakeSwap (CAKE) with a total weekly return of 42% followed by Aave (AAVE) which ended the week with a 27% return. CAKE saw a migration to V2 while Aave launched its liquidity mining incentives program that ends July 15, 2021. Aave has also benefited from its Polygon (MATIC) integration, providing a Layer 2 scaling solution.\n\nFollowing a similar pattern as the top assets, all DeFi assets have seen a steady decline in volatility. Notably, PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Terra’s (LUNA) volatility decline the most during March moving from a range of 18-20% to a 6%-10% range. Across DeFi assets, MakerDAO (MKR) experienced an uptick in mid-April sending the token’s volatility to 9.8% making it the most volatile asset of the group on a rolling basis. As of April 29th, volatility in the top DeFi assets ranges from 5% to 10%.\n\nOver the past 30 days, the correlation structure of the top DeFi assets hasn’t shown strong tendencies towards either side of the correlation spectrum. Correlations in the group currently range from a low of -20% to a high of 84%. One exception is Terra (LUNA) which has become increasingly uncorrelated with the rest of the assets week-over-week.\n\nCorrelation between DeFi assets and Bitcoin followed a similar pattern over the past months. To various degrees, all DeFi assets saw a decline in February followed by an increase all through March. Starting in April, correlations started to decline once again but recently started to pick up. As of yesterday, MakerDAO (MKR) has the lowest correlation to Bitcoin at 15% and Aave (AAVE) has the highest at 63%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nCurrencies had a mixed week of performance. Similar to the rest of the assets in the report, all currencies decline over the weekend with the majority recovering by the end of the week. Unlike DeFi assets, not all currencies ended the week with positive returns much less in the double-digits. Monero (XMR) came in at the top with a total return of 9.5% followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) with a weekly return of 5%. Dash (DASH) and Bitcoin SV (BSV) were the laggards of the group with weekly returns of -5%.\n\nSimilar to the top asset’s volatility chart, the two notable assets with higher volatility within the currencies group are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP). The rest of the assets have volatility ranging between 3% and 8%.\n\nUnsurprisingly, correlations among currencies are concentrated on the high end of the correlation spectrum. As stated above, this is not the case for Dogecoin (DOGE). Week-on-week the token has become slightly more uncorrelated with the rest of the group.\n\nCorrelations between currencies and Bitcoin have seen some dispersion in the past few months. Starting April, correlations have been on the rise reaching over 40% across most assets in the group. Again, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the exception seeing a sharp decline in mid-April ending the month with a correlation to Bitcoin of 0.05%.\n\nSmart Contract Platforms\n\nSimilar to the currency sector, smart contract platforms ended the week with mixed results. Solana (SOL) was the clear outperformer of the group ending the week with a strong double-digit performance of 32%. Interestingly, Solana was one of the few assets in this report that showed high resilience to the weekend’s market drop only dipping below the zero line for a few hours. Cosmos (ATOM), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA) also ended the week with a two-digit performance of 14%, 13%, and 10% respectively. EOS and VeChain (VET) ended the week in the red with weekly returns of -8.6% and -13%. VET’s price action was on the back of a strong month in April where the price nearly doubled at its peak.\n\nVolatility levels in smart contract platforms have been on the rise starting in April. Similar to other charts in the report, there was a steady decline starting in March. However, most smart contract tokens are seeing their volatility increase during April. Most notably is Tron (TRX) which saw an increase in volatility from 6% to 12% over the current month. The rest of the assets have volatility ranging between 4.5% and 11% with Ethereum (ETH) being the least volatile asset of the group.\n\nCorrelation among smart contract platforms tends to be on the positive side. One particular exception is Solana (SOL). Over the past 30 days, the token has become increasingly uncorrelated with the assets in the rest of the group. On a weekly basis, the correlation continued to decrease reaching levels as low as -45%.\n\nThe story is the same when looking at the correlation between Bitcoin and Solana (SOL). While most smart contract platforms have a correlation higher than 20%, Solana’s correlation with Bitcoin went negative in mid-April reaching a low of -50% as of April 29th.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges\n\nThe decentralized exchange sector was the best performing during the week. As a whole, DEXs ended the week with a total return of 29%. The top DEX based on performance was PancakeSwap (CAKE) with a total weekly return of 42%. Uniswap (UNI) came in second place with a 24% return. Kyber Network (KNC), Bancor (BNT), and Loopring (LRC) were the losing assets of the group ending the week with negative performance.\n\nVolatility in the sector has been relatively stable over the past few months. As mentioned previously, PancakeSwap (CAKE) is the only asset with a notable decrease in volatility among decentralized exchanges. As of yesterday, volatility across the group is below 10%.\n\nCorrelations within the group aren’t concentrated on either side of the spectrum. One thing to note however is that Uniswap (UNI), PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Rune (RUNE) have seen some decline in their correlation over the past week relative to the other assets in the sector.\n\nIn terms of correlation with Bitcoin, decentralized exchanges are moving in a similar direction. All correlations are above 30% ranging from a low of 33% to a high of 76%.\n\nWeb-3\n\nWeb 3 assets had the widest dispersion across all sectors. Helium (HNT) and Arweave (AR) had a phenomenal week ending with returns of 36% and 30% respectively. Most assets ended the week with performance ranging from -3% to 7%. Stacks (STX) and Siacoin (SC) ended the week at the bottom of the group with returns of -5% and -8%.\n\nAsset volatilities have been quite jumpy among Web-3 assets. During March, Livepeer (LPT) and Storj (STORJ) saw a significant jump in their volatilities reaching levels above 25%. Similarly, Stacks (STX) experienced a similar increase from 5% to 25% volatility. As of April 29th, volatility in the group has stabilized below 11% with the exception of Stacks (STX) which is currently at its highest level since March.\n\nWeek-over-week correlations among Web-3 have mostly remained stable. The two to note are Stacks (STX) and Arweave (AR) which are becoming increasingly uncorrelated with the rest of the group.\n\nCorrelations with Bitcoin have been widely different across the Web-3 sector. While all have remained above zero, some assets have reached levels as high as 84% over the past three months which means the sector might not be as uncorrelated as some would like to believe. As of April 29th, correlations in the sector range from a low of 35% to a high of 73%. Since many Web3 projects possess their own blockchains or interoperable protocols it will be interesting to watch and see if they remain correlated to Bitcoin or start to break away as a sector.\n\n',

      title: "Messari Daily Brief Feb. 18, 2021: What would make you bearish?",
      content:
        '<a href="https://messari.io/newsletter?utmsource=dailybrief&utmmedium=toplink&utmcampaign=newsletter">SUBSCRIBE</a>\n\nI posed what I thought was a pretty good question the other day on twitter, and got some excellent, thoughtful responses. It’s a sort of bookend to Tuesday’s post on the costliness of maximalism: "If you’re a BTC or ETH maximalist what would have to happen to shake conviction in your preferred network?”  \n  \nHere were some of my favorite responses:  \n  \nFor Bitcoin:  \n  \n+ Market cap dominance reversal: “If BTC lost the number 1 market cap, it would shake a lot of maxi conviction.” and "Despite some of the common narrative of sharp crashes, I think that if Bitcoin failed it would be a slow gradual decline. a) Innovation and lightning slow/ fail; b) Adoption rate slows; c) Price has a slow prolonged bearish decline; d) Governments over-regulate; e) community loses vigor.” In other words, Bitcoin is innocent until proven guilty.  \n  \n+ Mining collapse causes security issues: "Price collapses far enough and long enough that ASIC mining becomes permanently unaffordable. This means something like a 4-year bear market at a pre-ASIC price... This would potentially destroy the security of the network. Without specialized ASIC miners, the network is fragile.” I agree. Network security in proof-of-work networks is one of those “hidden-in-plain-sight” risks that is perennially overstated, but presents a legitimate geopolitical concern. (China)  \n  \n+ Government attacks: “A reversion to the gold standard. Maybe if governments banned bitcoin for institutions and new central bank digital currencies backed by actual reserves.” This seems…unlikely.  \n  \n+ Quantum attacks: "Quantum computers solving SHA-256 before we realize. Fraudulent transactions for months/years. Slow movement from the dev team to switch the Hash.” and "Speaking as a BTC maxi scientist, only a persistent double-spend could falsify my belief in the correctness of the Nakamoto Consensus thesis (and thus resolve the Bitcoin Experiment).” A lot of things will break in a world with quantum computing. Crypto double spends are the least of our worries in that case.  \n  \n+ Craig Wright as Satoshi: "Not a maxi, but if Craig Wright moved tokens from Satoshi\'s wallet.” At first glance, this would destroy bitcoin’s creator mythology, but prove to be a temporary (and perhaps net positive) shock to the system. I put the likeliness of this scenario at <1%, but if it did happen, than CSW certainly seems to be the type of “watch the world burn” figure, and I think uncertainty over his massive sales would curb institutional bitcoin interest.  \n  \nFor Ethereum:  \n  \n+ ETH Killers gaining traction: “If something like DOT, SOL, etc. made a fast trustless bridge and DeFi projects started migrating over and benefitting from cheap transactions at scale while ETH 1.0 thrashed around in scaling hell for another 1+ year, I’d probably jump ship.” and "If the main blue chips built on ethereum switch to ADA through the ERC-converter because there is no more value on using ETH until the next phase of ETH2 scaling. DOT is promising in the NFT space so I’d say a successful dapp / superfarm looks promising.” And "ETH - current DEFI/NFT\'s majors moving to other chains.” and “ETH - Other layer 1 blockchains become easier to develop for and cheaper/faster to use. Especially if crosschain solutions take off.” and "Other L1s moving first with innovation and unlocking value (hint: unlock staking liquidity).” and "If anything worthwhile was built on anything other than Ethereum, it could give me pause.

        '<a href="https://messari.io/newsletter">SUBSCRIBE</a>\n\nThe crypto markets have obviously been hot, but what we’ve seen in DeFi, Layer1 protocol tokens, and NFTs year-to-date has been nuts.  \n  \nIt seems like there’s two schools of thought at this point. On the one hand, there’s a belief that a correction in the long-tail is imminent. If for no other reason than many of these assets have 3-5x’d (or more) in the past six weeks. On the other, there’s the sense that we might be in a mini-period of consolidation while the markets take a breath. Sideways, but not down. August 2017, not Jan 2018.  \n  \nMy sense is that if BTC/ETH keep rallying, other assets will perform similarly: it\'s much more difficult to beat the blue chips than it was six weeks ago. If BTC/ETH falter or the stonk markets correct sharply, then look out beloowwwwww. That leads to the same conclusion: it may be safer to be in BTC/ETH (and the super long-tail of speculative assets if you’re adventurous), than it is to ride (or FOMO into) the recent DeFi/Layer1 winners.  \n  \nCapped upside, big downside for the billion dollar also-ran networks, unless you think BTC dominance will drop below 60% or ETH Layer1 dominance will dip below 60% or DeFi’s miraculous ascent will continue unabated. It\'s a good time to HODL, hit the books, and plan for the next phase. If boom times continue, you’re ready. If a correction hits, you can go hunting vs. spraying/praying.  \n  \nI’m watching BTC as a shield for the rest of the crypto markets, and looking at relative valuations otherwise.

        'I’m still not sure anyone truly appreciates just how crazy this bull market is about to get. The only real remaining constraint on crypto growth will be from political headwinds and aggressive negative incumbent lobbying efforts. I’ve written this before, but we’ve already entered the “then they fight you” period.\n\nThree things stood out to me in the past couple of days, in particular. They are notable because they (inexplicably) weren’t even on my radar until I saw them hiding in plain site.\n\nBTC-ETH is now bigger than a) the top five U.S. banks combined, b) the top five Chinese banks combined, c) the top 10 rest of the world banks combined, and d) all public companies except for the MAGAs (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon) and Saudi Aramco. As a former JPM banking pee-on, it is pure bliss to see BTC at 2x JPM market cap and climbing. I like this site.\nAt current volumes, Binance is bigger than NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange in terms of both revenue & profitability. With a 10bp blended trading fee (this is just spot volumes, not to mention all other revenue lines), Binance does $10bn++ in run-rate revenue with insane margins. (We have a clean <a href="https://messari.io/exchanges">spot volume filter here</a>.) It’s likely that Coinbase will come out of the gates trading north of ICE in terms of market cap, too, and yet that business is still significantly smaller than Binance and Huobi. ICE and its brethren may have to buy itBit or Gemini or Bittrex in order to catch up, as they are the only exchanges ICE could afford if they don’t end up being content riding Bakkt all the way.\nAnd finally, bitcoin just tipped into the $1 trillion market cap club on a "fully diluted" basis. There are now thirty $5 billion+ networks on a fully-diluted basis, and sixty liquid unicorn networks, which is twice as many as we saw in the previous peak in January 2018. And climbing rapidly. (Check out this screener to keep tabs on the <a href="https://messari.io/screener/four-commas-C4C7B3DB">three comma club</a>.)\n\nMy sense is that the hot ball of money is just picking up speed. There will be corrections along the way, but from what heights?\n\nHave a nice weekend, and 新年快乐!\n\nHeadlines that matter:\n\n<a href="https://messari.io/intel/grid">INTEL</a>: ALPHA, CRV, KNC, AVAX, COMP, 0X, FET, KIN, YFI (+ 20 updates)\nJack Dorsey & Jay-Z fund bitcoin development with 500 BTC (The Block)\nJPMorgan employees are clamoring for crypto (CoinDesk)\nValiu raises $5.25 million to expand LatAm crypto remittances (Decrypt)\nReflexer Labs raises $4mm to scale RAI stablecoin (CoinDesk)\nKraken launches investment arm to keep up with rivals (The Block)\nJed McCaleb sold $69 million of XRP in a week (Decrypt)\nPolkamarket prediction market plans initial DEX offering\nUMA launches KPI options and a proposed airdrop (UMA)\nDaily Shade: Bitcoin is for money makers, not losers like Uber',

        'Once Elon Musk changed his twitter bio to #bitcoin, it seemed “inevitable” that he’d make a sizable bet on the currency. We just didn’t know how large it would be. Today, we got our answer as Tesla announced that it has purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin for its balance sheet, representing ~15% of the company’s net cash.\n\nI suppose this is cause for celebration, but I don’t feel the need to dwell on it. Instead, I’m thinking “what’s next?” Bitcoin and Ethereum have seemed like inevitable growth stories since the COVID fiscal spending surge, DeFi summer, and ETH 2.0 launch. I’m spending much more time thinking about what the future has in store for CEX/DEX tokens, on-chain lending, asset management, cross-chain infrastructure, NFTs, Web 3 assets, algorithmic stablecoins, and other new applications we haven’t yet imagined.\n\nWhen BTC is your checking account, and ETH is your high-yield savings account, it pays to look beyond the crypto reserves for new opportunities. Fortunately, we’ve got the best team in the game covering those bases daily, and making sense of the crypto frontier.\n\nIf you haven’t already, you might want to redeploy a sliver of the 10%+ pop in your crypto checking to unlock all of Messari\'s Pro features.

        'Short post this morning, because I’d prefer to re-share and underscore Balaji’s excellent post from this week on why India should "buy bitcoin vs. ban it." The argument is thorough, punchy, and compelling, and I keep thinking about the potential for countries who make the (logical) first-mover leap into crypto. The Michael Saylors of big governments if you will.\n\nWhat’s happened in Singapore, Portugal, Wyoming, Miami, etc. with respect to crypto friendly regulation feels like kindling. At some point, a big democratic government will stop and say: “why aren’t we taking this more seriously?” They\'ll change the course of their economic and geopolitical fate for decades by embracing crypto and the influx of talent and capital that would come with it. India feels like the most exciting candidate to prosper from the crypto tech boom. I hope logic and free markets prevail and they capitalize on the generational opportunity.\n\nRead the full post from Balaji.

        'The past couple of days have been…weird. Fred Wilson called it the revenge of retail. CNBC has become a complete clown car. Some of the world’s richest men are overnight nouveau populists (e.g. Chamath), <a href="https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin">Dogecoin rallied 8x in a day</a> for the memes, and there’s suddenly a feeling that maybe the “institutions" aren’t as smart as they think they are. After all, the smart money sure has missed a lot recently.\n\nThey missed COVID. They missed Tesla. They’ve missed crypto. They forgot to make sure their short positions couldn’t be easily cornered. They underestimated retail sentiment shifts and populist anger. Basically, the smart money continues to miss exponentials, while getting paid 2/20 for picking up pennies in front of steamrollers - beating the market by 200 bps sometimes, then going bankrupt amidst volatility.\n\nThe crowds continue to outperform expectations, and I still think they are underestimated.\n\nThat brings me to two points. First, I’d encourage emerging analysts to escape their living hells of tradfi and apply to our community analyst program, which has been Messari\'s exclusive pool of candidates for full-time hires and contractors recently, and proven to be a career accelerant for those who\'ve used it as a platform to spring into other killer jobs throughout crypto. We have a lot in store for this program, and this community will set the standard for producing high-quality crypto research that wildly outperforms any new legacy finance entrants that think they’ve got it all figured out.\n\nSecond, I angel invested in Roll this fall, a platform for creating social monies, and something Bradley Miles (the founder) calls “user-generated capital.” Mason wrote about <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-value-capture-of-social-tokens">the value capture of social tokens</a> earlier this week, and we wanted to have Bradley share his thoughts in this companion piece. User-generated capital is an emerging category that uses social money, NFTs, and DeFi as a way to grow the creator economy, and further decentralizes how talent is identified, incentivized, and rewarded. A lot of the ideas Bradley shares are sparks, and I’m fairly certain UGC will play a major role in further tilting the balance of power from corrupted institutions to more reliable individuals.\n\nHere’s <a href="https://messari.io/article/the-rise-of-user-generated-capital-bridging-the-creator-economy-and-decentralized-finance">Bradley’s piece</a> (and a summary below).\n\nHave a great weekend!\n\nHeadlines that matter:\n\n<a href="https://messari.io/intel/list">INTEL</a>: Alpha, Cardano, YFI, Cosmos, KEEP, Ethereum Classic, Filecoin (+10 updates)\nCoinbase announced proposed direct listing\nRobinhood gets $1billion in emergency funding from investors\nGrayscale files for DOT, AAVE, XMR, ATOM, EOS, and ADA trusts (Decrypt)\nElon puts bitcoin in his twitter bio.

        'Something changed this week. A switch was flipped, and the door swung open for mass adoption of bitcoin, ethereum, DeFi, and web3 assets. I’m not talking about Gamestop per se. I’m talking about "loss porn." Revenge. And the channeled fury of the masses.\n\nThe sideshow of the GameStop retailers vs. Melvin hedge fund managers was entertaining towatch at least. But seeing Wall Street Bets get summarily executed on Discord; Robinhood suspend buying of retail investors’ preferred stocks; and tech influencers (Chamath, Elon, Portnoy) stoke flames of populist outrage really hits a trifecta. The winnings will be paid out in crypto.\n\nIn marketing, you generally want to appeal to people’s vices when selling them something new: lust (mating game), greed (financial game), pride (status game), etc. If you can appeal to multiple vices at the same time, you’ve got the kindling for something big.\n\nSince day one in crypto, the appeal has mostly been about greed (speculation, and number go up). Sure there are some cool emerging applications, and “save-the-world” fringe political elements, but real talk: most people get into crypto to make money. Some, in high-inflation states or oppressed situations, come out of fear and to keep their money, but that’s a small minority. Number go up is where it’s at.\n\nThe coordinated effort to curb “retail market manipulation” by suspending free trade in only one direction (to benefit shorts) and suspending speech and assembly (to reduce potential legal liability), gives us a new vice to tap into: wrath. Buy bitcoin to hedge against inflation, and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your government to fck off. Buy ethereum to secure the fledging decentralized financial system and potentially make a lot of money, but also to tell your bank to fck off. Buy DeFi assets to boost liquidity, additional investment in better financial infrastructure, and potentially to make a lot of money, but also to tell your brokerage, lender, or asset manager to f*ck off.\n\nI think the best take of the day, goes (ironically) to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian: "We vote with 2 things in the USA: votes & dollars. The internet has obviously had a huge impact on our democratic process. Now we\'re seeing the impact it\'s having when the internet revolutionizes the dollar-votes, too.” No media outlet (tech or otherwise), financial institution, or politician will be safe if they continue to disenfranchise the dollar-votes of the "unwashed masses.”\n\nI think this fury will have some staying power, as you don’t mess with people’s money.\n\nnoddingjack.gif\n\nHeadlines that matter:\n\n<a href="https://messari.io/intel/list">INTEL</a>: Aave v2; new Grayscale Trust filings; FIL updates; CREAM, Terra, Thorchain updates (+ 15 more)\nFred Wilson on GameStop.

        'There’s something to be said for minimizing conflicts of interest as a researcher, and minimizing distractions as an entrepreneur. That’s why for the past three years, I paused angel investing (and most trading) to focus on the build-out of Messari and stuck to a handful of long-term holds in my crypto portfolio (BTC, ETH, FIL, ZEC) instead.\n\n"There’s more enterprise value in my company stock than there is in trying to beat the bellwethers” is pretty straightforward logic to follow.\n\nBut at some point late last year - DeFi’s late summer boom, and the aggressive rebound off the November lows - it started to become a liability to not invest. Not necessarily from a cash returns standpoint (though there’s certainly some FOMO there), but because I started feeling behind the innovation curve for the first time in a long time: with new Layer1\'s, DeFi markets, Web 3 apps, and more. That’s a dangerous feeling for someone running a niche information business. There’s no good reason to submit to self-imposed, counterproductive restrictions when conflicts can be managed.\n\nSince August, all Messari research team members have been required to disclose crypto holdings that represent   5% of their portfolios, and have done so in <a href="https://messari.io/article/messari-employee-holdings-policy-and-disclosures">this document</a> that’s updated monthly. It doesn’t eliminate conflicts, but it highlights them without being overly punitive to our in-the-weeds team. We also rolled out “watch lists” on the home page that cover all assets our individual analysts think are interesting.\n\nNeither disclosures nor watch lists are investment advice. Still, users might benefit from the “don’t show me what you think, show me your portfolio” default, which balances transparency and accountability.\n\nFor my part, BTC and ETH are the only 5%+ positions I hold today. I own some other liquid cryptos (DeFi blue chips, FIL/SIA, ZEC, etc.), but my bigger goal is to deploy a good chunk of my portfolio into 30-40 seed deals this year.\n\nI’ll be sharing my first handful of investments Thursday, and updating that list monthly as the portfolio companies allow. If you’re a seed stage fund, and think-i-can-be-helpful^tm, keep me in mind for your syndicates! Investing as an angel vs. GP allows me to deploy smaller checks and punch above my weight in cap tables.
